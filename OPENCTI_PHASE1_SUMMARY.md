# OpenCTI Integration - Phase 1 Complete

## Version: 8.4.0
## Date: 2025-10-20

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Phase 1 of the OpenCTI integration has been successfully implemented. This provides **manual IOC enrichment** through the OpenCTI threat intelligence platform.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **OpenCTI Client** (`opencti_client.py`)
- Full-featured Python client using official `pycti` library (v6.3.11)
- Maps caseScope IOC types to OpenCTI observable types
- Searches indicators with intelligent fallback (Indicator → Observable)
- Calculates risk scores (0-100) based on confidence and relationships
- Extracts threat actors, campaigns, malware families, and labels
- Health check and connection testing
- Batch enrichment support (for Phase 2)

### 2. **System Settings Integration**
- New OpenCTI configuration section in System Settings page
- Settings stored:
  - `opencti_enabled` (boolean) - Enable/disable integration
  - `opencti_url` (string) - OpenCTI server URL
  - `opencti_api_key` (string) - API authentication token
  - `opencti_auto_enrich` (boolean) - Auto-enrich toggle (Phase 2)
- Test connection button with real-time feedback
- User-friendly info boxes explaining benefits

### 3. **API Endpoints**
- **POST `/settings/test-opencti`** - Test OpenCTI connection
- **POST `/ioc/<ioc_id>/enrich-opencti`** - Enrich single IOC with threat intelligence

### 4. **UI Integration**
- **IOC List Page**: Added blue 🔍 button next to each IOC
- **Enrichment Modal**: Beautiful modal displaying:
  - Risk score badge (color-coded: 🔴 Malicious, 🟡 Suspicious, 🟢 Low Risk)
  - Labels and tags
  - Threat actors
  - Campaigns
  - Malware families
  - Indicator types
  - TLP marking
  - Timestamp
- Graceful "Not Found" handling for clean indicators

---

## 📊 Risk Scoring

The system calculates a **0-100 risk score** for each indicator:

| Score | Status | Color | Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| 70-100 | 🔴 Malicious | Red | High confidence threat |
| 40-69 | 🟡 Suspicious | Orange | Medium confidence |
| 0-39 | 🟢 Low Risk | Green | Low confidence or clean |

**Score Calculation:**
- Base score from confidence level (max 50 points)
- +30 points for malicious indicator types
- +20 points for threat actor relationships

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setup (One-time)
1. Navigate to **Management → System Settings**
2. Scroll to **OpenCTI Threat Intelligence** section
3. Check **Enable OpenCTI Integration**
4. Enter your OpenCTI server URL (e.g., `https://opencti.yourcompany.com`)
5. Enter your API key (from OpenCTI profile settings)
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify
7. Click **Save Settings**

### Using IOC Enrichment
1. Navigate to **IOC Management** page
2. Find the IOC you want to check
3. Click the blue **🔍** button in the Actions column
4. View the enrichment modal with threat intelligence
5. Use the information to prioritize your investigation

### API Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "found": true,
  "message": "Found in OpenCTI - 🔴 Malicious",
  "score": 85,
  "details_html": "...",
  "enrichment": {
    "indicator_id": "...",

## 🎨 UI Screenshots

### System Settings - OpenCTI Section
The settings page now includes a dedicated OpenCTI section with:
- Enable checkbox with status badge
- Collapsible settings panel
- Test connection button
- User-friendly explanations

### IOC Management - Enrichment Button
Each IOC row now has three action buttons:
- ✏️ Edit (existing)
- 🔍 Check in OpenCTI (NEW)
- 🗑️ Delete (existing)

### Enrichment Modal
Beautiful modal showing:
- Large risk score badge
- All threat intelligence details
- Clean, professional dark theme
- Close on outside click

---

## ⚠️ Phase 1 Limitations

Phase 1 provides **manual enrichment only**:
- ✅ Click button to check IOC
- ❌ No automatic enrichment on IOC add
- ❌ No enrichment data persistence
- ❌ No bulk enrichment (one at a time)
- ❌ No enrichment badges in IOC list

These features are planned for **Phase 2**.

---

## 🔮 Phase 2 Features (Future)

Phase 2 will add:
1. **Auto-Enrich on IOC Add** - Automatically check new IOCs
2. **IOCEnrichment Table** - Persist enrichment data in database
3. **Bulk Enrichment** - Enrich all IOCs with one click
4. **Enrichment Badges** - Show risk scores in IOC list
5. **Scheduled Re-enrichment** - Auto-update intelligence daily/weekly
6. **Dashboard Integration** - Show enrichment stats

---

## 🧪 Installation on Server

When you're ready to deploy to your Ubuntu server:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
cd /opt/casescope
git pull

# 2. Install new dependency
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pycti==6.3.11

# 3. Restart services
sudo systemctl restart casescope
sudo systemctl restart casescope-worker

# 4. Verify
sudo systemctl status casescope
sudo systemctl status casescope-worker
```

No database migration needed for Phase 1!

## 📝 Testing Checklist

After installation, test these features:

- [ ] System Settings → OpenCTI section visible
- [ ] Can enable OpenCTI integration
- [ ] Can enter URL and API key
- [ ] Test connection works (shows ✅ or ❌)
- [ ] Settings save successfully
- [ ] IOC Management page shows 🔍 button on each IOC
- [ ] Clicking 🔍 shows loading state (⏳)
- [ ] Modal displays enrichment data correctly
- [ ] Risk score badge color-coded properly
- [ ] Threat actors/campaigns visible (if available)
- [ ] "Not Found" message for clean indicators

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OpenCTI client not installed"
```bash
pip install pycti==6.3.11
```

### "Connection failed - check URL and API key"
- Verify OpenCTI URL is correct (https://...)
- Check API key from OpenCTI profile settings
- Ensure network connectivity to OpenCTI server

### "SSL certificate verification failed"
- The client uses `ssl_verify=False` for self-signed certificates
- Should work with internal/self-signed OpenCTI instances

---

2. **Prioritization** - Risk scores help focus on critical indicators
3. **Investigation Speed** - No need to leave caseScope to check threats
4. **Collaboration** - Share intelligence findings with team
5. **No Database Changes** - Phase 1 requires no schema updates
6. **Optional** - Works alongside existing IOC hunting
