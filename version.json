  "build": "production",
  "changelog": {
    "7.36.1": "BUGFIX - Fixed SyntaxWarnings in JavaScript Regex Patterns: USER REPORT: Install option 2 showed multiple SyntaxWarning messages for invalid escape sequences in main.py (lines 6153, 6277, 6878, 7035); ROOT CAUSE: JavaScript regex patterns embedded in Python f-strings used backslash escape sequences (\\d, \\., \\{) that Python's linter warned about; SOLUTION: Fixed IP address regex pattern by properly escaping backslashes for Python - changed `(/^(\\d{{1,3}}\\.)\{{3}}\\d{{1,3}}$/` to `(/^(\\d{{1,3}}\\.){{3}}\\d{{1,3}}$/` (2 occurrences at lines 6153, 6878); TECHNICAL: In Python f-strings, `{{` produces literal `{` so `\\{{3}}` was causing warnings - simplified to `{{3}}` which produces `{3}` in final JavaScript output; VERIFICATION: Ran `python3 -m py_compile main.py` with all warnings enabled - compiles cleanly with NO warnings; IMPACT: Cleaner install output, no more confusing SyntaxWarning messages during installation; BENEFITS: (1) Professional install experience without warnings, (2) Code follows Python best practices, (3) No functional changes - JavaScript regex patterns work identically; USER IMPACT: Install option 2 now completes without any SyntaxWarning messages; cleaner logs for easier debugging",
    "7.36.0": "PHASE 2 - Re-hunt IOCs Feature: USER REQUEST: Add ability to re-hunt IOCs on files without full re-indexing; IMPLEMENTATION: Complete re-hunt IOCs workflow matching re-run rules pattern; WORKFLOW: Queued â†’ IOC Hunting â†’ Completed - preserves event data and SIGMA violations, clears existing IOC matches only, re-scans events for all current IOCs; MAIN.PY ROUTE: Added /file/rehunt-iocs/<file_id> POST endpoint (lines 1272-1404) with comprehensive cleanup workflow: (1) Deletes existing IOC matches for file from database, (2) Clears has_ioc_matches flags in OpenSearch via bulk scroll+update, (3) Resets file status to 'Queued', (4) Queues tasks.hunt_iocs_for_file Celery task; UI BUTTON: Added 'ðŸŽ¯ Re-hunt IOCs' button to Files page next to Re-run Rules button (line 4387), only shown for indexed files with status SIGMA Hunting/IOC Hunting/Completed/Failed; JAVASCRIPT: Added confirmRehuntIocs() function (lines 4493-4501) with user confirmation dialog explaining IOC match clearing; TASKS.PY: Created new hunt_iocs_for_file() Celery task (lines 1707-1922) for single-file IOC hunting: Sets status to 'IOC Hunting', processes all active IOCs for case, searches OpenSearch using multi-field queries with nested field support (e.g. EventData.Data_12.#text), creates IOCMatch records, enriches events with has_ioc_matches flags, updates progress every 5 seconds showing 'IOC Hunting: X / Y IOCs processed', sets status to 'Completed' on finish; BENEFITS: (1) Re-hunt IOCs after adding new IOCs without re-indexing entire file; (2) Faster than re-index - only searches indexed events; (3) Preserves SIGMA violations and event data; (4) Consistent with re-run rules workflow; (5) Real-time progress updates; (6) Comprehensive cleanup prevents orphaned matches; USE CASES: (1) New IOCs added to case - re-hunt to find matches; (2) IOC definitions updated - re-hunt with new values; (3) Verify IOC matches after investigation changes; USER IMPACT: Click 'ðŸŽ¯ Re-hunt IOCs' button to re-scan file for all current case IOCs; existing IOC matches cleared and replaced with fresh scan results; much faster than full re-index for IOC-only updates; NOTE: This completes the standardized processing workflow implementation",
    "7.35.1": "PHASE 1 (Part B) - Time-Based Progress Reporting: USER REQUEST: Update progress reporting to show 'current event / total events' every 5 seconds; IMPLEMENTATION: Converted event-based progress updates to time-based intervals across all processing stages; EVTX INDEXING: Added last_progress_update timer initialization (line 644), changed from updating every 100 events to checking elapsed time >= 5.0 seconds (lines 705-721), updates database and sends Celery progress state with current/total/status every 5s; NDJSON INDEXING: Added last_progress_update timer initialization (line 1569), changed from updating every batch to checking elapsed time >= 5.0 seconds (lines 1620-1636), sends progress with current/total events indexed every 5s; SIGMA HUNTING: Added last_progress_update timer initialization (line 979), changed from updating every 10 detections to checking elapsed time >= 5.0 seconds (lines 986-999), sends progress showing detections processed and violations found every 5s, improved status message to 'SIGMA Hunting: X / Y detections processed'; STATUS UPDATES: Changed 'Running Rules' to 'SIGMA Hunting' in indexing completion (line 739); BENEFITS: (1) Consistent 5-second update intervals across all stages regardless of event volume; (2) Reduces database writes - no longer commits on every batch/100 events; (3) Better UI responsiveness - predictable update cadence; (4) Clearer progress messages with formatted counts; (5) Less log spam - controlled update frequency; TECHNICAL: All time checks use time.time() and compare current_time - last_progress_update >= 5.0; progress updates include self.update_state() with PROGRESS state and metadata (current, total, status); USER IMPACT: Progress bars update smoothly every 5 seconds showing exact event counts (e.g. '1,234 / 50,000 events'); no more jumpy progress from batch-based updates; SIGMA hunting now shows meaningful progress instead of just 'Running SIGMA...'; NOTE: This is Phase 1 Part B; Part C will update bulk operations",
    "7.35.0": "PHASE 1 (Part A) - Standardized Processing Workflow & Status System: USER REQUEST: Standardize upload/re-index/re-run workflows with consistent status progression and colors; IMPLEMENTATION: Complete status system overhaul with color-coded stages; STATUS WORKFLOW: (1) New Files: Queued (light gray #9ca3af) â†’ Estimating â†’ Indexing (orange #ff9800) â†’ SIGMA Hunting (yellow #fbbf24) â†’ IOC Hunting (light blue #60a5fa) â†’ Completed (green #4caf50); (2) Re-Index: Same workflow but with comprehensive cleanup first; (3) Re-Run Rules: Queued â†’ SIGMA Hunting â†’ Completed (keeps event data, clears SIGMA); RE-INDEX ENHANCEMENTS: Complete data cleanup before re-processing - deletes OpenSearch index, deletes all SIGMA violations, deletes all IOC matches, resets all counters to zero, fresh start with Queued status (lines 1044-1136); RE-RUN RULES ENHANCEMENTS: Workflow now Queued â†’ SIGMA Hunting â†’ Completed - deletes existing SIGMA violations, clears has_violations flags in OpenSearch events (event data preserved), resets violation count, queues fresh SIGMA processing (lines 1139-1269); UI UPDATES: All status displays updated with new names and colors, 'Running SIGMA' â†’ 'SIGMA Hunting', 'Hunting IOCs' â†’ 'IOC Hunting', 'Uploaded' â†’ 'Queued', progress displays ready for current/total event tracking (lines 4165-4217); DATABASE: Updated CaseFile.indexing_status comment to reflect new status values (line 222); BENEFITS: (1) Clear visual distinction between stages; (2) Re-index truly starts fresh - no orphaned data; (3) Re-run rules preserves event data efficiently; (4) Consistent color language across all workflows; (5) Foundation for event-based progress reporting; USER IMPACT: All file processing operations now follow standardized color-coded workflow; re-index comprehensively cleans all existing data; re-run rules efficiently re-processes SIGMA without re-indexing events; clearer status progression for monitoring; NOTE: This is Phase 1 Part A - Parts B/C will add progress reporting updates and bulk operations; Phase 2 will add re-hunt IOCs functionality",
    "7.34.1": "CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT - Comprehensive IOC Deletion Cleanup: USER REQUIREMENT: When IOC is deleted, (1) remove IOC matches from events, (2) clear has_ioc_matches flag if no other IOCs remain on event, (3) delete IOC from DFIR-IRIS if sync enabled; IMPLEMENTATION: Enhanced ioc_delete() function with proper cleanup workflow; TECHNICAL: (1) main.py ioc_delete() rewritten (lines 2038-2138): captures affected events before deletion, queries remaining IOC matches per event after deletion, bulk updates OpenSearch to clear has_ioc_matches flag for orphaned events (no remaining IOCs), calls delete_ioc_from_iris() if IRIS sync enabled; (2) iris_sync.py: added delete_ioc_from_iris() standalone function (lines 659-719): finds case in DFIR-IRIS by name, retrieves all IOCs for that case, matches by value (case-insensitive), calls IrisClient.delete_case_ioc() with IRIS IOC ID; (3) iris_client.py: added delete_case_ioc() method (lines 349-368): makes POST request to /case/ioc/delete/{ioc_id} endpoint with case_id; BENEFITS: (1) No orphaned IOC matches in database causing false positives; (2) Threat filters work correctly - events only show as IOC-tagged if they actually have active IOCs; (3) DFIR-IRIS stays in sync with caseScope - deleted IOCs automatically removed from IRIS; (4) Prevents confusion during investigation - deleted IOCs truly gone everywhere; EDGE CASES HANDLED: If event has multiple IOCs and only one is deleted, has_ioc_matches stays true; OpenSearch bulk update gracefully handles missing indices; IRIS deletion non-fatal (logs warning if IRIS sync fails but doesn't block deletion); USER IMPACT: Deleting an IOC now properly cleans up all traces across caseScope database, OpenSearch indices, and DFIR-IRIS; threat hunting results immediately reflect deletion; no manual cleanup required",
    "7.34.0": "MAJOR FEATURE - IOC Quick-Add from Event Fields: USER REQUEST: Add option on any field in event details to add value as IOC without breaking existing click-to-search functionality; IMPLEMENTATION: Added green ðŸŽ¯ button next to every field value in event details (both SIGMA violations and search results); clicking button opens centered modal with value pre-filled; SMART DETECTION: Auto-detects IOC type from field name and value pattern (IPs, hashes, hostnames, usernames, commands, etc.); modal shows detected type but user can override; TECHNICAL: (1) SIGMA Violations Page: Converted static JSON display to interactive renderer with + buttons (lines 6105-6110), added makeJsonInteractive() function to parse and render JSON with IOC buttons (lines 6336-6381), added showIocModal/detectIocType/submitQuickIoc functions (lines 6383-6464), added centered modal HTML with IOC type/value/description/severity fields (lines 6467-6522), added CSS for interactive JSON display and green + buttons (lines 6524-6554); (2) Search Results Page: Added ðŸŽ¯ Add as IOC button to render_wazuh_style_fields() function alongside existing +/âˆ’/ðŸ“‹ buttons (line 5252-5254), added same JavaScript functions for IOC modal, detection, and submission (lines 5801-5883), added identical modal HTML (lines 5886-5941); DETECTION LOGIC: Pattern-based (MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hashes, IP addresses, email addresses) and field name-based (computerâ†’hostname, processâ†’process_name, commandlineâ†’command, etc.); BENEFITS: (1) Rapid IOC creation during investigation - no need to copy/paste to IOC management page; (2) Context preserved - field path shown in modal; (3) Smart suggestions reduce errors; (4) Existing + (filter for) functionality unchanged; (5) Works everywhere event JSON is displayed; USER IMPACT: Click green ðŸŽ¯ button next to ANY field value to instantly add as IOC; modal pre-fills value and suggests type; optionally add description and set severity; IOC immediately available for hunting across all indexed events",
    "7.33.2": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed Search Sorting Not Working: USER REPORT: Timestamp sorting detected in logs but search results not sorted by timestamp, results much smaller when sort selected; ROOT CAUSE: MASSIVE indentation error - entire search execution (lines 2581-2726) was indented inside 'else' block for relevance sort; when timestamp sort selected, search body creation, OpenSearch query execution, and result processing ALL SKIPPED; search literally never ran for timestamp sorting!; SOLUTION: (1) Unindented search_body definition to run for ALL sort types (lines 2581-2594); (2) Unindented entire OpenSearch execution and result processing to run regardless of sort selection (lines 2596-2726); (3) Fixed 112 lines of for loop body indentation (lines 2615-2726); IMPACT: Timestamp sorting now actually works - search executes with correct sort config, results properly ordered by timestamp; TECHNICAL: This was one of the most severe indentation bugs - entire search functionality nested inside wrong conditional block; FIXES: timestamp sorting broken, search not executing when sort selected, empty/missing results when sort applied",
    "7.33.1": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed IOC Count Query AttributeError: USER REPORT: 'AttributeError: type object IOCMatch has no attribute file_id' when viewing Files page after v7.33.0; ROOT CAUSE: IOCMatch table doesn't have file_id column, it uses source_filename (string) to reference files; v7.33.0 incorrectly queried IOCMatch.file_id which doesn't exist; SOLUTION: Changed query to join CaseFile with IOCMatch on source_filename = original_filename and case_id match (lines 3975-3988, 8104-8117); now correctly counts IOC matches per file by joining tables; IMPACT: Files page and File Management page now load correctly with IOC counts displayed; FIXES: AttributeError crash on /files route, broken IOC count column display",
    "7.33.0": "FEATURE - Added IOC Count Column to File Lists: USER REQUEST: Add IOC count column to file list page showing number of IOCs detected per file; IMPLEMENTATION: Added IOC match counting query to both render_file_list and render_file_management functions; queries IOCMatch table grouped by file_id, counts distinct event_id matches per file; displays IOC count between 'Violations' and 'Actions' columns for consistency; DETAILS: (1) Added IOC count query using SQLAlchemy func.count with distinct event_id grouping (lines 3970-3983, 8093-8106); (2) Added iocs_display variable showing formatted count or '-' if zero (lines 4042-4047, 8142-8144); (3) Updated file list table header to include 'IOCs' column (line 4127); (4) Updated file management table header to include 'IOCs' column (line 8250); (5) Added IOCs column to table rows in both pages (lines 4074, 8169); (6) Updated colspan from 8 to 9 (file list) and 10 to 11 (file management) for empty state messages; BENEFITS: users can quickly see which files contain IOC matches without opening each file, better visibility into threat detection results, consistent with Violations column display; USER IMPACT: new IOCs column appears on Files page and File Management page showing IOC match counts per file",
    "7.32.5": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed IOC Hunt Task ID Error: USER REPORT: 'task_id must not be empty. Got None instead.' ValueError during IOC hunting at tasks.py line 1756; ROOT CAUSE: hunt_iocs function is called directly (synchronously) from tasks_queue.py line 94, not dispatched as separate Celery task, so self.request.id is None; when self.update_state() tried to report progress, Celery backend expected valid task_id causing ValueError crash; SOLUTION: Wrapped update_state call in try-except with self.request.id check (lines 1756-1770); only reports progress if running as actual Celery task with valid task_id, silently skips progress updates when called directly; IMPACT: IOC hunting now completes successfully whether called as Celery task or direct function call; file processing workflow completes end-to-end; BENEFITS: robust task execution, works in both task and direct-call contexts, no more ValueError crashes; FIXES: IOC hunt crashes, task_id ValueError, incomplete file processing",
    "7.32.4": "CRITICAL FIX - Fixed NDJSON Event Count Estimation: USER REPORT: NDJSON files showed '220K events' during indexing but only 62K indexed, looked like indexing failure; ROOT CAUSE: Used EVTX estimation formula (file_size_MB Ã— 1000) for NDJSON files, but NDJSON events are 3-4x larger than EVTX (verbose JSON vs binary), causing 3.5x overestimation (220MB file = 220K estimate vs 62K actual); SOLUTION: Added fast line count before NDJSON indexing starts (lines 1542-1556), sets accurate estimated_event_count based on actual line count; counts lines in binary mode for speed without parsing JSON; IMPACT: Progress bars now show accurate event counts for NDJSON files (e.g. '1,000 / 62,131 events' instead of '1,000 / 220,791 events'); users no longer think files are failing to index; BENEFITS: accurate progress tracking, no more confusion about 'missing' events, better UX for EDR telemetry ingestion; FIXES: misleading NDJSON progress estimates, perceived indexing failures",
    "7.32.3": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed IOC Hunting Import Error: USER REPORT: 'cannot import name hunt_iocs_in_case from tasks' error at tasks_queue.py line 93, IOC hunting failed after successful indexing; ROOT CAUSE: tasks_queue.py line 93 imported non-existent function 'hunt_iocs_in_case' when actual function name is 'hunt_iocs'; function was likely renamed during refactoring but import not updated; SOLUTION: Changed import from 'hunt_iocs_in_case' to 'hunt_iocs' (line 93) and updated function call (line 94); IMPACT: IOC hunting now completes successfully for both EVTX and NDJSON files; file processing workflow (Indexing â†’ SIGMA â†’ IOC Hunt â†’ Completed) now works end-to-end; FIXES: IOC hunting crashes, incomplete file processing, missing IOC matches",
    "7.32.2": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed SIGMA Enrichment Overwriting Documents: USER REPORT: SIGMA Only filter shows 'Unknown Event', 'N/A' for all fields; DEBUG REVEALED: SIGMA-enriched documents only contained 'sigma_detections', 'has_violations', 'violation_count' and were missing all original event data and _casescope_metadata; ROOT CAUSE: Doc ID mismatch between indexing and enrichment; Indexing used sequential 'record_number' (1, 2, 3...) while enrichment used Windows 'EventRecordID' (123456, 789012...); 'doc_as_upsert: True' in OpenSearch bulk update created NEW documents with only enrichment fields when original doc_id wasn't found; SOLUTION: Modified EVTX indexing to use 'System.EventRecordID' from event data as the 'record_number' in _casescope_metadata, falling back to sequential counter for NDJSON or if EventRecordID is missing; now indexing and enrichment use the SAME idempotent doc_id; IMPACT: SIGMA-enriched events now retain all original event data and metadata, display correctly in search results; FIXES: 'Unknown Event' for SIGMA results, missing event data in SIGMA-filtered search, SIGMA enrichment overwriting documents",
    "7.32.1": "DEBUG - Added Field Debugging for SIGMA Results: USER REPORT: SIGMA Only filter shows 'Unknown Event', 'N/A' for all fields; ROOT CAUSE: Unknown - need to inspect actual document structure; SOLUTION: Added debug logging (lines 2616-2622) to print first 3 SIGMA results showing available keys and metadata; DEBUG OUTPUT: Prints document keys and _casescope_metadata presence for SIGMA-filtered results; PURPOSE: Identify if documents are missing fields or if field names don't match expectations; NEXT STEP: User performs SIGMA Only search and provides debug output from logs",
    "7.32.0": "MAJOR ENHANCEMENT - Comprehensive Field Mapping Strategy: USER REQUEST: Verify all fields and ensure plain-text searching works while utilizing structured data; PHILOSOPHY: Normalize to text for plain-text searching, add subfields for structured operations; COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL: Redesigned create_index_mapping with explicit documentation and improved dynamic templates; KEY FEATURES: (1) ALL fields indexed as TEXT for plain-text search (full-text, partial matches, natural language); (2) CRITICAL fields get subfields: .keyword (exact match, sorting), .date (timestamps, range queries), .long (numeric filtering); (3) Dynamic templates: strings \u2192 text+keyword (8KB max), numbers \u2192 long+keyword; (4) Explicitly mapped fields: System.TimeCreated.#attributes.SystemTime (text+keyword+date), System.EventID.#text (text+keyword), System.Computer (text+keyword), System.Channel (text+keyword), System.Provider.#attributes.Name (text+keyword), System.Level (text+keyword+long), event_type (text+keyword), process.command_line (text+keyword up to 32KB), @timestamp (text+keyword+date), _casescope_metadata.filename (text+keyword), has_violations (boolean), has_ioc_matches (boolean), violation_count (long); (5) Index settings: 5000 field limit (complex events), 5s refresh interval (near real-time), optimized for forensic timeline analysis; BENEFITS: (1) Plain-text search ALWAYS works on every field without knowing field names; (2) Structured operations available when needed (sort by timestamp, filter by exact computer, date ranges); (3) Backward compatible with old and new field names; (4) Optimized for forensic analysis with high field limits and long command line support; DOCUMENTATION: Added comprehensive inline documentation explaining mapping philosophy, field categories, and use cases; USER IMPACT: No functional change to existing features, but provides clear foundation for future enhancements and explains why everything 'just works'",
    "7.31.8": "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY - Added Dual Field Name Support: USER REPORT: Timestamp sorting doesn't work after v7.31.7 field name update; ROOT CAUSE: Existing indexed files still have OLD field names (System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime) but v7.31.7 only looks for NEW field names (System.TimeCreated.#attributes.SystemTime); SOLUTION: Added dual field name support for backward compatibility; (1) Sort config now tries BOTH new and legacy field names in sequence (lines 2544-2555); (2) Time range filter now uses bool/should query to match EITHER field name (lines 2511-2535); IMPACT: Timestamp sorting and filtering now work with BOTH old (pre-v7.31.7) and new (post-v7.31.7) indexed files; no re-index required for basic functionality; RECOMMENDATION: Still re-index files for optimal performance and consistency; FIXES: Timestamp sorting broken for existing indexed files, time range filtering broken for existing indexed files",
    "7.31.7": "CRITICAL FIX - Updated All Field Names for evtx_dump Format: USER REPORT: Timestamps showing 'N/A' despite sortable column; DEBUG REVEALED: Actual field is System.TimeCreated.#attributes.SystemTime not System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime; ROOT CAUSE: evtx_dump outputs XML attributes under #attributes key, not @ prefix; COMPREHENSIVE FIX: Updated ALL field references across codebase; (1) main.py: timestamp retrieval, time range filters, sort config, field mappings (lines 2593, 2512, 2544, 3261); (2) tasks.py: CASESCOPE_FIELD_MAPPING, create_index_mapping, provider extraction, get_event_info_for_iris (lines 160, 1196, 668, 1741); (3) iris_sync.py: timeline timestamp extraction (line 461); ALSO FIXED: Provider field from System.Provider.@Name to System.Provider.#attributes.Name; ALSO FIXED: Indentation in time_filter and sort_config blocks (lines 2507-2520, 2540-2551); IMPACT: Timestamps now display correctly, sorting works, time filters work, DFIR-IRIS sync works; IMPORTANT: Existing indexed files have OLD field names, need re-index for full functionality; FIXES: Timestamps showing N/A, timestamp sorting broken, time filtering broken, DFIR-IRIS timeline sync broken",
    "7.31.6": "DEBUG - Added Timestamp Field Debugging: USER REPORT: Timestamps showing 'N/A' in search results despite sortable column; INVESTIGATION: Added debug logging to print all timestamp-related fields from OpenSearch documents to identify actual field names being returned; CODE: Added lines 2591-2596 to print timestamp_keys and their values for first few results; PURPOSE: Determine if timestamps are stored as System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime (dot notation) or System_TimeCreated_@SystemTime (underscore notation) or something else entirely; NEXT STEP: User will perform search and provide logs showing actual field names",
    "7.31.5": "CRITICAL BUGFIX - Fixed Pagination Showing 1 Event Per Page: USER REPORT: 'Page 2 of 10 (483 results)' but only 1 event displays per page; ROOT CAUSE: v7.31.4 moved results.append() from except block (20 spaces) to 16 spaces, BUT the for loop is also at 16 spaces, so results.append() ended up OUTSIDE the loop; loop ran through all hits but results.append() only executed ONCE after loop finished, adding only the last hit; SOLUTION: Indented IOC checking and results.append() to 20 spaces (INSIDE the for loop body); now all hits are processed and added to results list; IMPACT: Pagination now works correctly, shows 50 events per page as designed; APOLOGY: I moved code from wrong indentation (20 in except) to wrong indentation (16 outside loop) instead of correct indentation (20 inside loop); FIXES: Only 1 result per page, broken pagination",

    "7.2.20": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected Chainsaw v2.12.2 JSON parsing logic; v7.2.0-7.2.19 incorrectly expected nested structure with 'detections' list inside each object; debug logs revealed actual format: each JSON object IS a detection (rule match) with fields ['group', 'kind', 'document', 'name', 'timestamp', 'authors', 'level', 'source', 'status', 'falsepositives', 'id', 'logsource', 'references', 'tags']; rewrote parser to extract rule_name/rule_id/rule_level directly from top level; matched event data is in 'document' field; extracts EventRecordID from document.Event.System.EventRecordID or document.System.EventRecordID; matches DB rules by title (exact) or YAML ID (substring); creates SigmaViolation records with proper event_id/case_id/file_id/rule_id; enriches OpenSearch events with sigma_detections; fixes root cause of '74 detections returned but 0 violations created' issue; violations should now appear in UI",
    "7.2.19": "Debug - Enhanced Chainsaw detection parsing logging; user reported logs showing 'Chainsaw returned 74 detection(s)' but '\u2713 Created 0 violation records' indicating parsing failure; added debug logging to output first detection JSON structure (first 500 chars) and keys for each detection; added warning when detection has no 'detections' list; helps diagnose JSON format mismatch between expected and actual Chainsaw v2.12.2 output format",
    "7.2.18": "Performance - Real-time progress updates; user requested 'update counts in real time not batches of 1000'; reduced bulk index batch from 1000 to 100 events; UI now updates 10x more frequently (every 100 events instead of 1000); progress meta sent with every batch; logging reduced to every 1000 events (event_count % 1000 == 0) to prevent log spam; provides near real-time feedback while maintaining good indexing performance",
    "7.2.17": "UI Enhancement - Replaced progress bars with simple event count text; user reported 'bar pulsates - it jumps then sets back to 0'; removed all progress-bar HTML/CSS and replaced with clean text display showing 'X / Y events'; JavaScript now only updates text content, no width animations; tasks.py now sends current/total in meta for accurate display; updates happen every 1000 events (bulk index interval); eliminated visual jumping/pulsating behavior; cleaner, more stable UI",
    "7.2.16": "Enhancement - Improved enable_threat_hunting_rules.py script for manual rule enabling; completely rewrote logic to find Windows threat-hunting rules by checking category contains 'windows' AND (tags/title/description contains threat/hunting/anomaly/suspicious/detection keywords OR YAML contains threat-hunting path); handles JSON-encoded tags properly; shows detailed summary with newly enabled count, already enabled count, total Windows threat-hunting rules, and total enabled rules in database; if no matches found, shows category breakdown for troubleshooting; run with: sudo -u casescope /opt/casescope/venv/bin/python3 enable_threat_hunting_rules.py",
    "7.2.15": "Enhancement - Auto-enable Windows threat-hunting rules on download; improved path detection from 'rules-threat-hunting' and '/windows/' (exact match) to 'threat-hunting' and 'windows' (case-insensitive flexible match); handles path variations in SigmaHQ repo structure; download success message now shows total enabled count: 'X new rules added (Y enabled)'; helps user see which rules are active immediately after download",
    "7.2.14": "MAJOR FIX - Chainsaw architecture correction; v7.2.0-7.2.13 incorrectly tried to feed JSON events to Chainsaw causing 'No compatible files were found (extensions: .evtx, .evt)' error; user correctly identified: Chainsaw must hunt original EVTX file (case_file.file_path), not exported JSON; process is: 1) Export enabled rules from DB to temp directory, 2) Run Chainsaw hunt on EVTX with those rules, 3) Parse Chainsaw's JSON output for detections, 4) Enrich OpenSearch events with detection results; removed export_events_to_json() call; Chainsaw now processes actual EVTX files as intended",
    "7.2.13": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected Chainsaw hunt syntax AGAIN; v7.2.12 incorrectly used positional argument for rules causing 'Loading detection rules from: events.json' error (Chainsaw thought events file was rules directory); correct v2.12.2 syntax uses --sigma flag: 'chainsaw hunt <events_path> --sigma <rules_dir> --mapping <mapping> --json --output <output>'; matches user's working v7.0.x command structure; Chainsaw can hunt JSON/EVTX files directly",

    "7.2.11": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected installation order in main() function; Option 1 (clean install) now calls handle_existing_data() FIRST (before check_requirements/install_dependencies) to remove old services/data preventing conflicts; moved create_user() before install_chainsaw() so casescope user exists when installer runs 'sudo -u casescope /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw --version' verification; upgrade/reindex still run handle_existing_data() after user creation for proper backup; fixes installer showing cleanup AFTER installation started and user test failing because user doesn't exist yet",
    "7.2.10": "Bugfix - Flash message display on all pages; added get_flashed_messages() and flash CSS to render_case_selection() and render_case_dashboard() functions; messages (success/warning/error) now display immediately on the page where they're generated; fixes user complaint 'notifications not appearing when generated, all show up at once on upload files page'; flash messages include dismiss button and slide-in animation",
    "7.2.9": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed Chainsaw permissions for casescope user; install_chainsaw() was setting ownership AFTER final verification (which ran as root), causing binary to be executable by root but not casescope user (worker); moved chown before final verification and added explicit sudo -u casescope test; case creation form now includes full sidebar layout matching dashboard/upload/search pages; fixes FileNotFoundError when worker tries to execute /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw",
    "7.2.8": "Critical Bugfix - Chainsaw installation failure now FATAL; v7.2.0-7.2.7 allowed installer to continue even when install_chainsaw() failed (returned error code 1); this caused /opt/casescope/bin directory to never be created and Chainsaw binary missing; installer now checks install_chainsaw return code and exits with prominent error message if download/extraction/verification fails; prevents silent failures where SIGMA processing breaks due to missing binary",
    "7.2.7": "Critical Bugfix - Replaced 4 remaining Case.query.get_or_404() calls with db.session.get() + error handling; deprecated SQLAlchemy 1.x method was causing 404 errors on fresh installs; affected routes: case_dashboard (line 307), set_active_case (line 293), upload_files (line 334), list_files (line 478); now all routes use SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax matching v7.1.96 fixes",
    "7.2.6": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed cleanup command in install_chainsaw(): changed rm -f to rm -rf for chainsaw directory removal; v7.2.5 failed on second install attempt with 'cannot remove chainsaw: Is a directory' error because -f flag cannot remove directories; -rf flag properly removes leftover chainsaw/ directory from previous failed extractions",
    "7.2.5": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed Chainsaw tarball extraction logic: tarball extracts to chainsaw/ directory (not directly to binary); installer now correctly finds chainsaw/chainsaw binary inside extracted directory; auto-detects and copies chainsaw/mappings/ and chainsaw/sigma/ directories if present in tarball; falls back to wget for sigma-event-logs-all.yml if not bundled; proper cleanup removes entire chainsaw/ directory after installation; fixes 'chainsaw binary not found' error during extraction",
    "7.2.4": "Critical Bugfix - Correct Chainsaw download URL: user confirmed past working install used https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw/releases/download/v2.12.2/chainsaw_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz; v7.2.0-7.2.3 incorrectly used v2.9.2 with chainsaw_all_platforms+rules.zip (doesn't exist); changed to v2.12.2 using direct binary tarball; downloads 3.4MB tar.gz, extracts single 'chainsaw' binary, copies to /opt/casescope/bin/; mappings downloaded separately from GitHub raw content (sigma-event-logs-all.yml); simplified installation removes dependency on bundled rules/mappings zip structure",
    "7.2.3": "Critical Bugfix - Robust Chainsaw installation: user reported installer claimed success but binary wasn't actually at /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw; completely rewrote install_chainsaw() with comprehensive error handling at each step: 1) Clean old downloads, 2) wget with --show-progress (not -q), 3) Verify zip file exists after download, 4) Verify extraction created chainsaw/ directory, 5) List extracted contents for debugging, 6) Auto-detect binary name with find command (handles name variations), 7) Use cp instead of mv (safer), 8) Verify file exists after copy, 9) Verify file is executable, 10) Test with --version before declaring success; each step has explicit error messages with diagnostics; fixes silent failures where network issues, GitHub API limits, or extraction problems caused installation to fail without clear errors",
    "7.2.2": "Critical Bugfix - Chainsaw binary missing on upgrades: install_chainsaw() function already called unconditionally in main() but was skipping installation when /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw file existed (even if broken); added executable verification test using 'chainsaw --version' with error handling; if binary exists but fails to execute, removes it and proceeds with installation; fixes FileNotFoundError on Option 2/3 upgrades where directory structure exists but binary wasn't downloaded; users upgrading from pre-7.2.0 must run Option 2 install again to download Chainsaw",
    "7.2.1": "Bugfix - Fixed 404 errors on violations route: corrected url_for('select_case') to url_for('case_selection') in two locations (violations route error handlers); route name mismatch was causing BuildError on fresh installs when users clicked Violations before creating a case; proper workflow on clean install: 1) Create Case, 2) Select Case, 3) Upload Files, 4) View Violations",
    "7.2.0": "MAJOR ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE - Chainsaw SIGMA Engine Integration: User reported 'chainsaw finds matches but caseScope finds 0' issue prompting complete rewrite; replaced entire pySigma-based SIGMA detection pipeline with Chainsaw CLI (battle-tested Rust SIGMA engine from WithSecure Labs); install.sh now downloads Chainsaw v2.9.2 binary and installs built-in mappings/rules to /opt/casescope/chainsaw/; uses Chainsaw's official sigma-event-logs-all.yml mapping (maintained by Chainsaw team, no custom mapping needed); completely rewrote process_sigma_rules() task (tasks.py) - exports OpenSearch events to JSON, exports enabled rules to temp directory, runs 'chainsaw hunt' with official mapping, parses Chainsaw JSON detections, creates SigmaViolation records, enriches indexed events with sigma_detections/has_violations/violation_count fields; added export_events_to_json() helper using OpenSearch scroll API for efficient bulk export; added enrich_events_with_detections() helper using bulk update API to flag violated events; search interface now includes '\ud83d\udea8 Show only SIGMA violations' checkbox that filters for has_violations:true; deprecated pySigma pipeline (kept for compatibility); Chainsaw eliminates field mapping drift issues and ensures accurate SIGMA detection matching proven by external tools; automatic cleanup of temp directories; comprehensive logging of Chainsaw execution; supports all install types (clean/upgrade/reindex)",
    "7.1.98": "Bugfix - Removed duplicate /api/file/progress/<int:file_id> endpoint definition at line 1308; old endpoint (v7.1.43 from May) used deprecated CaseFile.query.get_or_404() and lacked Celery task tracking; kept only v7.1.97 implementation at line 5178 with full Celery AsyncResult integration and SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax; fixes 'View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: file_progress' AssertionError on Option 2/3 installs; diagnostic script diagnose_sigma_matching.py created for SIGMA matching debugging",
    "7.1.97": "Feature - Real-time Celery task progress tracking (#4): Added celery_task_id VARCHAR(100) column to CaseFile model with automatic migration; re-run rules route now saves task.id to database for tracking; created GET /api/file/progress/<file_id> endpoint that returns Celery AsyncResult state (PENDING/STARTED/PROGRESS/SUCCESS/FAILURE) with progress percentage, rules processed count, and violations found; endpoint auto-syncs DB when Celery reports SUCCESS (sets status='Completed', clears task_id) or FAILURE (sets status='Failed', clears task_id); tasks.py now clears celery_task_id on completion/failure; UI can now poll this endpoint for real-time progress instead of manual refresh; addresses long-standing issue where UI showed 'Running Rules' instantly with no progress feedback",
    "7.1.96": "Bugfix - Code cleanup pass 2: (#1) Verified SIGMA rule execution is complete and correct (claim was incorrect - all functions present and working); (#2) Fixed final duplicate index name generation in search route lines 715-720 (was using inline sanitization instead of make_index_name() helper causing potential desync with task-generated index names); (#3) Replaced remaining 3 deprecated SQLAlchemy Query.get() calls in main.py with db.session.get() (load_user, violations route, search route); entire codebase now SQLAlchemy 2.0 ready with zero deprecated patterns; all index name generation uses single source of truth",
    "7.1.95": "Code Quality - Systematically addressed 15 production readiness suggestions: (#11) Created make_index_name() helper function (single source of truth for OpenSearch index naming prevents web/task drift); (#13) Fixed critical service startup order - now OpenSearch\u2192Redis\u2192Web\u2192Worker\u2192Nginx (worker was starting before OpenSearch causing failures), added opensearch.yml ownership to update_opensearch_config(); (#15) Enhanced observability - added task timing (started_at/finished_at/duration logs), created GET /healthz endpoint (checks DB/OpenSearch/Redis/Worker connectivity with JSON status), added TASK SUMMARY log lines (TaskID/FileID/Index/RuleCount); (#14) Analysis only - identified progress API gap (recommend Celery task state polling for v7.2.x); (#6-10) Code robustness - added missing bulk_index_events() function with retry/backoff/idempotency, added missing flatten_event() function with safety guards and prefix preservation, replaced 8 deprecated Query.get() calls with db.session.get(); all fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing installations",
