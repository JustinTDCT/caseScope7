Hash matches but filename is different = new record; 2. hash and filename match = no new record'; PROBLEM: v9.4.13 duplicate detection only checked file_hash - if DESKTOP-A_Security.evtx (hash: abc123) exists and DESKTOP-B_Security.evtx (hash: abc123) is uploaded, marked as duplicate; BUT these are legitimately different files from different systems that happen to have identical content (e.g., empty Security.evtx logs); USER INSIGHT: Same hash + different filename = DIFFERENT SOURCE SYSTEMS (should accept!); Same hash + same filename = TRUE DUPLICATE (should reject); FORENSIC LOGIC: Two Windows systems often have identical empty/default logs (same content, same hash); but they're from DIFFERENT SYSTEMS so we need both files for forensic completeness; DUPLICATE DETECTION REFINEMENT: OLD v9.4.13 - Check: case_id + file_hash; Result: DESKTOP-A_Security.evtx accepted, DESKTOP-B_Security.evtx rejected (both have same hash); NEW v9.4.14 - Check: case_id + original_filename + file_hash; Result: DESKTOP-A_Security.evtx accepted, DESKTOP-B_Security.evtx ALSO accepted (different filenames!); IMPLEMENTATION: Updated 5 duplicate detection queries: (1) local_uploads.py line 302-306: ZIP-extracted EVTX files, (2) local_uploads.py line 408-412: Direct EVTX files, (3) local_uploads.py line 481-485: JSON/NDJSON files, (4) main.py line 197-202: HTTP ZIP extraction, (5) main.py line 1505-1510: HTTP chunked upload; ALL queries now use: filter_by(case_id=X, original_filename=Y, file_hash=Z); SKIPPED FILES UI TILE: Replaced '\u26a0\ufe0f Files w/ 0 Events' tile with '\ud83d\udccb Skipped Files'; shows COUNT of records in skipped_file table (duplicates, zero-byte, zero-events, corrupt); Updated /files route (line 1747): total_skipped = SkippedFile.filter_by(case_id).count(); Updated /file-management route (line 1798): total_skipped with optional case filter; Updated render functions (line 6272, 11476): accept total_skipped parameter; BENEFITS: (1) FORENSIC COMPLETENESS - accept files from different systems even with identical content; (2) ACCURATE DUPLICATES - only reject exact re-uploads (same filename + same hash); (3) BETTER VISIBILITY - UI shows count of truly skipped files; (4) AUDIT TRAIL - skipped files tracked with reason (duplicate_hash still logged but less frequent); EXAMPLE SCENARIO: Before v9.4.14 - Upload DESKTOP-A.zip (500 EVTX) \u2192 300 accepted, 200 duplicates; Upload DESKTOP-B.zip (500 EVTX) \u2192 250 accepted, 250 duplicates (rejected because hash match!); Total: 550 files from 1000 uploaded (45% rejection!); After v9.4.14 - Upload DESKTOP-A.zip (500 EVTX) \u2192 300 accepted, 200 duplicates; Upload DESKTOP-B.zip (500 EVTX) \u2192 450 accepted, 50 duplicates (only TRUE re-uploads rejected!); Total: 750 files from 1000 uploaded (25% rejection - much better!); REAL-WORLD IMPACT: Two workstations with similar Windows configurations generate many identical empty logs; v9.4.13 would reject DESKTOP-B's empty Security.evtx because DESKTOP-A already had it; v9.4.14 accepts both because filenames are different (DESKTOP-A_Security.evtx vs DESKTOP-B_Security.evtx); USER IMPACT: More files accepted (forensically correct); fewer false-positive duplicates; skipped files count now visible in UI; can query skipped_file table to see what was rejected and why; TECHNICAL: original_filename already includes ZIP prefix (e.g., DESKTOP-A_Security.evtx); checking original_filename + hash ensures only exact re-uploads are rejected; skipped_file table provides audit trail for rejected files; DEPLOYMENT: git pull (gets local_uploads.py, main.py updates); restart casescope-worker (CRITICAL - processes uploads); restart casescope-web (UI tile updates); migration not needed (using existing table and columns); FILES CHANGED: local_uploads.py - Updated 3 duplicate queries (ZIP, EVTX, JSON); main.py - Updated 2 duplicate queries (HTTP ZIP, chunked upload) + UI tile + stats calculation; version.json - v9.4.14 changelog; NOTE: This is a patch release (9.4.13 \u2192 9.4.14) fixing duplicate detection logic; more forensically accurate (accepts files from different systems); fewer false-positive rejections; better audit trail visibility",
    "9.4.13": "FEATURE - Complete Audit Trail for Skipped/Duplicate Files (Forensic Completeness): USER REQUEST: 'can we create a DB record of the files skipped and why?'; 'as most 0 event files would be seen as duplicates; lets skip those entirely but we need a record of them for audit purposes'; 'file being skipped and why it was skipped (0 events, duplicate, etc)'; REQUIREMENT: Complete forensic audit trail of EVERY file uploaded including those skipped (duplicates, zero-byte files, zero-event EVTX files); DATABASE: NEW TABLE `skipped_file` - tracks ALL files that were uploaded but not processed; columns: id, case_id (FK to case), filename (original or ZIP-prefixed name), file_size (bytes), file_hash (SHA256 if calculated), skip_reason (enum: duplicate_hash, zero_bytes, zero_events, corrupt), skip_details (e.g., 'Duplicate of file_id 123'), upload_type ('local' or 'http'), skipped_at (timestamp); relationships: case (backref skipped_files); SKIP REASONS: (1) duplicate_hash - File with same SHA256 already exists in case (skip_details shows which file_id); (2) zero_bytes - File is 0 bytes (corrupt or empty); (3) zero_events - EVTX file converts to 0 events via evtx_dump; (4) corrupt - File couldn't be opened/processed; IMPLEMENTATION - LOCAL UPLOADS (local_uploads.py): Added log_skipped_file() helper function (lines 141-169) - creates SkippedFile record, commits to database, logs audit message; Updated process_local_uploads_two_phase() to accept SkippedFile model (line 174); Added skipped file logging at 7 locations: (1) ZIP-extracted EVTX zero-byte (lines 283-290), (2) ZIP-extracted EVTX duplicate (lines 298-305), (3) Direct EVTX zero-byte (lines 378-385), (4) Direct EVTX duplicate (lines 403-410), (5) Direct JSON/NDJSON zero-byte (lines 450-457), (6) Direct JSON/NDJSON duplicate (lines 475-482); IMPLEMENTATION - HTTP UPLOADS (main.py): Updated upload_finalize() duplicate check (lines 1481-1493) - creates SkippedFile record before returning 409 error; Updated extract_and_process_zip() (lines 173-215) - logs zero-byte files (lines 176-186), logs duplicate files (lines 203-214), commits all skipped records with extracted files (line 250); IMPLEMENTATION - TASKS (tasks.py): Updated process_local_uploads() wrapper (lines 3698-3715) - imports SkippedFile model, passes to two-phase processing function; CONSISTENCY: Both local uploads AND HTTP uploads now use identical skipping logic and audit logging; BENEFITS: (1) COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL - know exactly what was uploaded and why it wasn't processed; (2) FORENSIC COMPLETENESS - can explain every file that was submitted; (3) DUPLICATE ANALYSIS - see patterns (e.g., '512 of 784 files were duplicates'); (4) COMPLIANCE - permanent record for legal/audit purposes; (5) TROUBLESHOOTING - understand why uploaded files don't appear in file list; (6) NO DATA LOSS - zero-event files recorded even though not indexed; REPORTS ENABLED: 'Case received 1000 files: 700 unique (processed), 280 duplicates (skipped), 20 zero-byte (skipped)'; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM skipped_file WHERE case_id=2 AND skip_reason='duplicate_hash'; SELECT * FROM skipped_file WHERE case_id=2 AND skip_reason='zero_events'; HIDDEN FILES FEATURE: Reserved for manual user exclusion only (not auto-hiding); user explicitly clicks 'Hide' on file \u2192 excluded from searches; is_hidden flag remains for user-driven hiding; auto-hiding removed in favor of skip audit trail; USER IMPACT: Complete visibility into upload process - know why files don't appear; forensic completeness - can explain every file submitted to system; duplicate patterns visible - understand data redundancy; zero-event files tracked - know which logs were empty; compliance ready - complete audit trail for legal review; MIGRATION: New migration script migrate_skipped_files.py (86 lines) - creates skipped_file table with proper indexes; creates indexes on case_id, skip_reason, skipped_at; installer updated to run migration automatically (install.sh lines 1939-1950); TECHNICAL: Log functions called immediately before file deletion/skip; skip_details provides context (which file was duplicate of, which ZIP file extracted from); upload_type tracks whether file came from local folder or HTTP upload; indexed on case_id for fast case-level queries; DEPLOYMENT: git pull (gets models.py, local_uploads.py, main.py, tasks.py, migrate_skipped_files.py, install.sh updates); restart casescope-worker (CRITICAL - processes uploads); restart casescope-web (API endpoints); migration runs automatically on next install/upgrade; TEST: Upload ZIP with duplicates and zero-byte files \u2192 Check database: SELECT * FROM skipped_file WHERE case_id=X \u2192 Should see all skipped files with reasons; FILES CHANGED: models.py - Added SkippedFile model (40 lines); local_uploads.py - Added log_skipped_file() helper, updated 7 skip locations; main.py - Updated HTTP upload endpoints (2 locations); tasks.py - Passes SkippedFile to local uploads; migrate_skipped_files.py - NEW migration script; install.sh - Copies and runs migration; version.json - v9.4.13 changelog; WORKFLOW - Upload with Duplicates: User uploads DESKTOP-A.zip (500 EVTX) + DESKTOP-B.zip (400 EVTX) \u2192 System detects 250 identical files (e.g., empty Security.evtx logs) \u2192 Database: 650 CaseFile records (unique files) + 250 SkippedFile records (duplicates) \u2192 User sees: 'Registered 650 files (250 duplicates skipped)' \u2192 Query database for full audit trail; EXAMPLE AUDIT QUERY: SELECT filename, skip_reason, file_size, skipped_at FROM skipped_file WHERE case_id=2 ORDER BY skipped_at DESC; returns complete list of what was skipped and why; SECURITY: Only accessible via database queries (no public UI yet); skip_details may contain sensitive filename info; audit log records remain even if case deleted (FK on delete cascade); FUTURE: UI page to view skipped files (planned for v9.5); statistics on case dashboard showing skipped file counts; NOTE: This is a minor version (9.4.12 \u2192 9.4.13) adding new audit functionality; all processing logic unchanged; files still skipped for same reasons (duplicates, zero-byte, zero-events); difference is now they're permanently recorded for audit/forensic purposes",

    "9.0.0": "MAJOR REFACTOR - Modular Code Architecture for Better Maintainability: USER REQUEST: 'we have this 11K+ line main.py file - given it's size and complexity at this point would it make sense to split it out to multiple files?'; 'i have a fairly large bug list to address here so perhaps we should refactor'; 'do that whole process in one shot; create an archive folder and put all files not needed for a clean install and operation into that archive folder'; ROOT PROBLEM: main.py grew to 11,506 lines with 68 routes, 12 database models, numerous helper functions, and utility code all in one file; code navigation was difficult (scroll through thousands of lines to find functions); git diffs became massive (single file changes); bug fixing was error-prone due to lack of separation of concerns; multiple developers couldn't work on different features without merge conflicts; SOLUTION - Modular Architecture: Created 3 new modules to extract reusable components from main.py: (1) models.py (336 lines) - All 12 SQLAlchemy database models (User, CaseTemplate, AuditLog, SavedSearch, SearchHistory, Case, CaseFile, SigmaRule, SigmaViolation, EventTag, IOC, IOCMatch, SystemSettings); models are now importable by any module; db instance initialized once and shared; (2) utils.py (113 lines) - Core utility functions: get_opensearch_client() - standardized OpenSearch connection factory, log_audit() - audit logging helper, format_bytes() - human-readable byte formatting, sanitize_filename() - security-safe filename cleaning, make_index_name() - OpenSearch index naming consistency; all functions now have proper docstrings; (3) main.py (11,170 lines) - Reduced from 11,506 to 11,170 lines (336 lines removed = 2.9% reduction); imports models and utils at top; all 68 routes remain in main.py (preserves working code, minimizes risk); db.init_app(app) called after import (proper Flask-SQLAlchemy pattern); ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS: (1) Models in separate file - easy to review all database schema in one place, can be imported by any future module (tasks.py, API routes, etc.), clear separation of data layer from application logic, changes to models don't trigger review of route code; (2) Utils in separate file - reusable functions accessible everywhere, standardized OpenSearch client creation (no more inline config), consistent audit logging across all routes, easier to unit test utility functions; (3) Main.py remains simple - imports replace ~336 lines of model definitions, routes remain in place (working code preserved), all functionality unchanged, easier to navigate routes without scrolling past models; ROOT CLEANUP: Moved 30+ non-essential files to archive/v9-refactor-cleanup/ directory: Development tools archived: check_code_quality.py, check_enabled_rules.py, clear_ioc_matches.py, enable_quality_rules.py, enable_threat_hunting_rules.py, enable_wal_mode.py, show_enabled_rules.py, diagnose_ioc_performance.sh, diagnose_system_state.py, ConvertEVTXtoJSON.sh, refactor_main.py (refactoring script); Migration scripts archived: migrate_audit_log.py, migrate_case_company.py, migrate_case_management.py, migrate_database.py, migrate_ioc_management.py, migrate_ioc_matches.py, migrate_search_enhancements.py, migrate_system_settings.py, migrate_timeline_tags.py (8 total); Documentation archived: ARCHITECTURE_V8.md, CHANGELOG.md, CODE_QUALITY.md, DFIR-IRIS_API_REVIEW.md, INSTALLER_VERIFICATION.md, IOC_FEATURE_PROPOSAL.md, OPENCTI_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md, REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md, SIGMA_BUG_FIX_GUIDE.md, V8_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md (10 docs); Other files archived: install.sh.backup, wazuh-agent.pkg; Original v8.6.2 main.py: Backed up to archive/main_v8.6.2_backup.py (11,506 lines); ROOT DIRECTORY NOW: Only 15 essential files at root level: main.py (application), models.py (NEW), utils.py (NEW), celery_app.py, tasks.py, tasks_queue.py, theme.py, wsgi.py, install.sh, requirements.txt, version.json, README.md, LICENSE, iris_client.py, iris_sync.py, opencti_client.py; CLEAN ROOT = easier git clone, clearer project structure, faster navigation, professional appearance; DEPLOYMENT IMPACT: git clone pulls clean repository with only essential files; install.sh works unchanged (no path changes); all routes work identically (zero functionality changes); existing databases compatible (no schema changes); systemd services restart cleanly; BENEFITS FOR BUG FIXING: (1) Find code faster - grep models.py for database issues, grep utils.py for helper functions, main.py focused on routes; (2) Smaller git diffs - model changes don't pollute route diffs, util changes isolated to utils.py, clearer commit history; (3) Easier code review - review models.py (336 lines) vs main.py (11K lines), focused changes in focused files; (4) Reduced merge conflicts - changes to utils rarely conflict with route changes, model updates isolated from business logic; (5) Cleaner development - new routes can import from models/utils, consistent patterns enforced by shared functions; BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: All 68 routes unchanged - same endpoints, same logic; All database models identical - same schema, same relationships; All utilities work same way - log_audit(), get_opensearch_client(), etc.; Celery tasks unchanged - import models from models.py (future improvement); Install process unchanged - git clone \u2192 install.sh option 2 \u2192 works; TESTING APPROACH: (1) Verify imports work (main.py imports models and utils), (2) Check db.init_app() called correctly, (3) Test OpenSearch client creation, (4) Verify audit logging works, (5) Ensure all routes still accessible, (6) Confirm install.sh option 2 works; FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: Phase 2 could extract routes to blueprints (routes/upload.py, routes/files.py, routes/search.py, etc.); would reduce main.py from 11K to ~2K lines; out of scope for v9.0 due to risk; current refactor provides 80% of benefits with 20% of risk; TECHNICAL DETAILS: Python imports handled at module level (top of main.py); db instance shared via models.py import; OpenSearch clients created via factory function; audit logging uses shared log_audit() from utils; all inline OpenSearch() calls replaced with get_opensearch_client(); USER IMPACT: Developers can navigate code faster - jump to models.py, utils.py, or routes in main.py; Bug fixes easier - find relevant code quickly, smaller diffs for review; Git operations faster - smaller files load quicker in editors; Clean install works perfectly - git clone gets only essential files; Zero downtime - existing installations upgrade seamlessly (git pull + restart); MIGRATION NOTES: Existing v8.x installations: git pull (gets new models.py and utils.py), systemctl restart casescope-web (imports new modules), zero downtime, zero data loss; New installations: git clone pulls clean repository, install.sh option 1 (clean install) works, option 2 (upgrade) works, all files in correct locations; NO BREAKING CHANGES: All routes work identically; all features unchanged; all integrations work (IRIS, OpenCTI); all background tasks work (Celery); install process unchanged; RISK MITIGATION: Original v8.6.2 main.py backed up to archive/; can revert by copying archive/main_v8.6.2_backup.py to main.py; models.py and utils.py can be deleted if needed (rollback to v8); git history preserves all changes; VERSIONING: Major version bump (8.6.2 \u2192 9.0.0) because: fundamental code architecture change, new module structure, file organization changed, developer workflow impacted; NOT because functionality changed (all features identical); PHILOSOPHICAL: v8.x was 'get features working'; v9.0 is 'organize code for maintainability'; future versions will benefit from this foundation; NOTE: This is a MAJOR release (8.x \u2192 9.0) changing code organization without changing functionality; all 68 routes work identically; all features unchanged; database schema unchanged; deployment process unchanged; this refactor makes bug fixing easier by organizing code into logical modules",

Error handling preserves partial success (shows failed_files list); DEPLOYMENT: New installs have full delete functionality; Existing installs: git pull + restart casescope-web; No database migrations required; TESTING NOTES: Test single file delete with each data type (OpenSearch, SIGMA, IOCs, tags); Test bulk delete with mixed file states (queued, indexing, completed, failed); Verify disk space reclaimed after deletion; Check audit_log for proper logging; NOTE: This is a patch release (8.6.0 \u2192 8.6.1) adding critical missing functionality; file deletion was completely absent before this release; now provides enterprise-grade file management with zero data residuals",
    "8.6.0": "FEATURE - Chunked Upload System (Fast Uploads Without Browser Buffering): USER REQUEST: 'with both the EVTX and ZIP uploads the debug doesnt show until it is done - which is fine i guess'; 'would chunk uploads solve this issue?'; USER CONTEXT: EVTX files upload at 300 MB/s server-side but ZIP files take minutes due to browser buffering entire file before sending; debug logs appear only AFTER browser finishes buffering; server is fast (800 MB/s disk, 1Gbps network) but browser buffers large files before HTTP multipart upload starts; ROOT CAUSE: Traditional HTML form uploads use multipart/form-data encoding which requires browser to: (1) Read entire file into memory, (2) Encode as multipart MIME, (3) Send as single HTTP request; for large files (500MB-3GB), this buffering takes minutes on slower WiFi (400-600 KB/s observed); server receives nothing during buffering so cannot show progress; SOLUTION: Implemented JavaScript-based chunked upload system that bypasses browser buffering; NEW ARCHITECTURE: BACKEND API ENDPOINTS (main.py lines 1651-1869): (1) POST /api/upload-chunk - receives individual 5MB file chunks, saves to temporary directory /opt/casescope/tmp/uploads/{uploadId}/chunk_{index}, returns status with chunksReceived count, no duplicate checking (deferred to finalize); (2) POST /api/upload-finalize - assembles all chunks into final file, calculates SHA256 hash during assembly, checks for duplicates, creates CaseFile database record, queues for processing pipeline, cleans up temp chunks, returns success with file_id; FRONTEND JAVASCRIPT (main.py lines 5382-5540): (1) uploadFileChunked(file, progressCallback) function - splits file into 5MB chunks using file.slice(), uploads each chunk sequentially to /api/upload-chunk, updates progress callback after each chunk (0.0 to 1.0), finalizes with /api/upload-finalize; (2) generateUploadId() - creates unique upload session ID using timestamp + random string; (3) Modified form submit handler - replaced XHR upload with async chunked upload loop, shows per-file progress during multi-file uploads, displays detailed status (X% - filename), error handling with retry capability; PROGRESS UI ENHANCEMENTS: Current file status: 'Uploading file 1 of 5: filename.evtx'; overall progress bar with percentage (0-100%); detailed status showing per-file progress: '47.3% - filename.evtx'; success/error messages with file counts; BENEFITS: (1) NO BROWSER BUFFERING - chunks sent immediately as they're read, (2) REAL-TIME PROGRESS - updates every 5MB instead of at end, (3) RESUME CAPABILITY - infrastructure supports resuming failed uploads, (4) MEMORY EFFICIENT - browser only holds 5MB at a time vs entire 3GB file, (5) FASTER PERCEIVED SPEED - progress visible immediately, (6) WORKS FOR ALL FILE TYPES - EVTX, ZIP, NDJSON, etc., (7) NO SERVER CHANGES - same processing pipeline after assembly, (8) BETTER ERROR HANDLING - can retry individual chunks vs entire file; TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION: Uses Fetch API with FormData for chunk uploads; file.slice(start, end) creates blob for each 5MB chunk; chunks assembled server-side with open(final_path, 'wb') then sequential chunk reads; SHA256 calculated during assembly (same as v8.5.2); duplicate detection after assembly (before CaseFile creation); temp directory cleanup with shutil.rmtree(); CHUNK SIZE RATIONALE: 5MB chunks balance between: (1) Progress granularity (updates every 5MB), (2) Request overhead (not too many requests), (3) Memory usage (reasonable browser memory), (4) Resume capability (not too much lost on failure); PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: Before v8.6.0 (Traditional Upload) - 500MB ZIP: Browser buffers 500MB (2-5 minutes) \u2192 Server receives in 1 second \u2192 Progress bar jumps 0% to 100%; User Experience: Slow, no feedback, looks frozen; After v8.6.0 (Chunked Upload) - 500MB ZIP: Browser sends 5MB chunks immediately \u2192 Progress updates every 5MB (real-time) \u2192 Server assembles fast; User Experience: Fast, responsive, clear progress; WORKFLOW: User selects files \u2192 Clicks Upload \u2192 JavaScript splits file into 5MB chunks \u2192 Each chunk uploaded via POST /api/upload-chunk \u2192 Progress bar updates smoothly 0\u2192100% \u2192 After all chunks uploaded \u2192 POST /api/upload-finalize assembles file \u2192 File queued for processing \u2192 User sees success message; SECURITY: Upload session ID prevents chunk mixing; chunk index validation prevents malicious reordering; size limits enforced during assembly; duplicate detection via SHA256 after assembly; temp directory isolated per upload session; EDGE CASES HANDLED: Missing chunks (finalize fails with error); upload interruption (temp chunks cleaned up); duplicate files (detected after assembly, temp file removed); oversized files (validated during assembly); concurrent uploads (isolated temp directories); USER IMPACT: ZIP uploads now show progress immediately instead of appearing frozen; 500MB files upload with smooth 0\u2192100% progress bar; no more 'is it working?' confusion during large uploads; multi-file uploads show per-file progress; faster perceived upload speed (progress visible); works on all file types (EVTX, ZIP, NDJSON); DEPLOYMENT: New installs automatically get chunked upload system; existing installs: git pull + restart casescope-web service; no database migrations required; backward compatible (old form upload code removed); BROWSER COMPATIBILITY: Requires modern browser with Fetch API and File.slice() (Chrome 42+, Firefox 39+, Safari 10.1+, Edge 14+); all browsers from 2016+ supported; NOTE: This is a minor version bump (8.5.4 \u2192 8.6.0) because it adds significant new upload functionality that fundamentally changes how files are uploaded; all existing processing pipelines (Index \u2192 SIGMA \u2192 IOC) unchanged;

(2) Modified upload_files() endpoint (lines 1417-1527 in main.py) - detects .zip extension and routes to ZIP handler, enforces 500MB limit for ZIP uploads (vs 3GB for individual EVTX files), saves ZIP temporarily during extraction, removes temporary ZIP after extraction complete, maintains backward compatibility for normal file uploads (EVTX, NDJSON, etc.), success count includes all extracted EVTX files, detailed flash messages for extraction results; (3) Updated frontend UI (lines 4925-4942 in main.py) - added .zip to file input accept attribute, updated upload info card to mention ZIP support with NEW badge, clarified size limits (3GB for files, 500MB for ZIP), updated dropzone secondary text to reflect ZIP limit; WORKFLOW: User uploads ATN44023.zip (500MB, contains 1000 EVTX files nested in directories) \u2192 System validates ZIP size and integrity \u2192 Extracts all EVTX files recursively \u2192 Prepends 'ATN44023_' to each filename \u2192 Creates 1000 CaseFile records with prefixed names \u2192 Queues all 1000 files for processing \u2192 Removes temporary ZIP \u2192 User sees 1000 files in Files page with consistent naming; SECURITY FEATURES: (1) Zip bomb protection - checks compression ratio, warns if >100:1, rejects if total uncompressed >50GB; (2) File size validation - each EVTX limited to 3GB after extraction; (3) Path traversal prevention - uses os.path.join for safe path construction; (4) Duplicate detection - SHA256 hash check per extracted EVTX; (5) Graceful error handling - bad ZIP files don't crash system; (6) Automatic cleanup - temp directories removed even on error; BENEFITS: (1) Bulk upload of large investigations (1000+ EVTX files in one operation); (2) Consistent naming with ZIP prefix makes file organization easy; (3) Each EVTX appears as separate file in UI with full tracking; (4) Standard processing pipeline (Index \u2192 SIGMA \u2192 IOC) for each file; (5) Progress tracking per file in Files page; (6) Duplicate skipping prevents re-processing same EVTX; (7) Handles nested directory structures in ZIP; (8) No manual extraction or file renaming needed; EXAMPLE NAMING: ZIP: ATN44023.zip contains Security.evtx \u2192 Extracted: ATN44023_Security.evtx; ZIP: Investigation.zip contains logs/System.evtx \u2192 Extracted: Investigation_System.evtx; ZIP: Evidence.zip contains server1/Application.evtx \u2192 Extracted: Evidence_Application.evtx; TECHNICAL: Uses Python's built-in zipfile module (no new dependencies), zipfile.is_zipfile() validates ZIP before extraction, os.walk() handles nested directory recursion, shutil.copy2() preserves file metadata, thread-safe extraction (one ZIP per upload), extract_and_process_zip() commits all CaseFiles in single transaction, queues processing after successful commit; EDGE CASES HANDLED: Empty ZIPs (shows warning 'No EVTX files found'), nested directories (flattened with prefix), duplicate EVTX in ZIP (skipped with log), all duplicates (shows warning, counts as error), ZIP with no EVTX (shows warning 'No EVTX files found'), malformed ZIP (error message, graceful failure), file size limits per EVTX (>3GB skipped), compression bombs (rejected before extraction); USER IMPACT: Analysts can now upload entire investigation archives in one click (ATN44023.zip with 1000 EVTX files); all files automatically extracted and prefixed for easy identification; each file tracked individually in Files page with status progression; standard SIGMA and IOC hunting applies to all extracted files; significantly faster than uploading 1000 files individually (one upload vs 200 batches of 5); consistent naming convention improves case organization; UI CHANGES: Upload page now shows '.zip archives' as supported format with NEW badge, file input accepts .zip extension, size limit clarified (500MB for ZIP), extraction status shown in flash messages ('Extracted 1000 EVTX files from ATN44023.zip'); TESTING: Verified ZIP extraction with nested directories, tested duplicate detection across extracted files, confirmed all EVTX files queue for processing, validated temp cleanup after extraction, tested error handling for malformed ZIPs, confirmed 500MB ZIP size limit enforcement, verified prefixing works with special characters in ZIP name;

    "7.1.92": "Enhancement - Massively improved Celery worker logging for debugging: added task_received signal showing exact moment tasks land on worker with full details (ID, name, args, kwargs, ETA, retries); added before_task_publish and after_task_publish signals for web process visibility; set worker_hijack_root_logger=False to preserve custom DEBUG logging; configured detailed worker_log_format and worker_task_log_format with task IDs; systemd service updated to use -Q celery -l DEBUG -E flags (explicit queue, debug level, event streaming); persistent logging to /opt/casescope/logs/celery_worker.log prevents journalctl truncation; provides complete task lifecycle visibility from publish to completion",
    "7.1.91": "THE REAL OPENSEARCH FIX - User discovered max_clause_count must be set in opensearch.yml cluster config, NOT jvm.options; JVM option was silently ignored; moved setting to opensearch.yml (indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 8192) for all 3 install options; update_opensearch_config() now modifies opensearch.yml with idempotent sed removal + append, restarts cluster, and verifies via API that running node has 8192; fixes all TooManyNestedClauses errors",
    "7.1.90": "Critical Fix - Fixed OpenSearch config update for existing installations; update_opensearch_config() now uses echo append instead of sed insert (which failed on old configs), and always starts/restarts OpenSearch after config changes (previously only restarted if already running, leaving new JVM option unapplied); ensures max_clause_count=8192 is properly applied for options 2/3",
    "7.1.89": "Critical Fix - Increased OpenSearch max_clause_count from 1024 to 8192 to support complex SIGMA rules; many SigmaHQ rules generate queries with >1024 boolean clauses causing TooManyNestedClauses errors; tasks now reach worker and process successfully but were failing at OpenSearch query execution; added -Dindices.query.bool.max_clause_count=8192 to JVM options; installer options 2/3 automatically update existing OpenSearch config without full reinstall",
    "7.1.88": "THE ACTUAL FIX - Fixed SIGMA rules returning 0 matches: tasks.py was wrapping pySigma output in query_string clause but OpensearchLuceneBackend.convert() returns a dict query structure not a string; passing dict to query_string.query created malformed OpenSearch query matching nothing; fixed by checking isinstance(opensearch_query, dict) and using dict directly as query body; tasks were running successfully but finding 0 violations because search was broken; added debug logging to show query type; v7.1.87 fixed task queueing, v7.1.88 fixes task execution",
    "7.1.87": "THE REAL FIX - Root cause was split-brain: web created SEPARATE Celery app instance with different config than worker; web and worker silently used different Redis keys (celery0-9 fan-out vs single 'celery' list); fixed by importing THE SAME celery_app instance in main.py from celery_app.py; added broker_transport_options={'priority_steps': [0]} to force single Redis LIST key; reverted from kombu manual queueing back to simple send_task() with queue='celery' and priority=0; web and worker now share identical Celery app configuration",
    "7.1.86": "Nuclear Fix - Completely bypassed Celery's send_task/signature/apply_async methods which failed to queue messages; now using kombu (Celery's underlying messaging library) to manually construct and publish task messages directly to Redis queue using exact Celery protocol format; worker receives properly formatted messages and executes tasks; eliminates all task registration/serialization issues in web app",
    "7.1.85": "Bugfix - Fixed worker SyntaxError 'def <lambda>(self, *args, **kwargs): invalid syntax' caused by lambda task stubs; Celery's head_from_fun() introspection generates code from function signature and cannot handle lambda syntax; replaced with proper named stub functions (_stub_start_file_indexing, _stub_process_sigma_rules) that Celery can properly introspect and serialize",
    "7.1.84": "Critical Fix - Registered task name stubs in web app's Celery instance using celery_app.task(name='tasks.X') with empty lambda implementations; Celery requires task to be registered locally (even if implementation is placeholder) for signature().apply_async() to properly serialize message body and queue to Redis; without registration, signature() behaves like send_task() creating only metadata; added task_create_missing_queues=True and task_default_delivery_mode=2 for persistence",
    "7.1.83": "Critical Fix - Replaced send_task() with signature().apply_async() throughout main.py (upload, re-index, re-run rules); send_task() with unregistered task name only creates result metadata in Redis but doesn't queue actual task message; signature() creates proper Celery task message and queues to Redis celery list for worker consumption; this is the root cause of queue length staying at 0",
    "7.1.82": "Critical Fix - Added task_default_exchange_type='direct' to both web (main.py) and worker (celery_app.py) Celery configurations; Celery requires explicit exchange_type when using custom routing to ensure web service and worker agree on message routing protocol; direct exchange type routes messages based on exact routing key match",
    "7.1.81": "Critical Fix - Fixed tasks not being queued to Redis: Celery send_task() was creating task metadata but not queuing actual messages because configuration didn't specify default queue/exchange/routing_key; added task_default_queue='celery', task_default_exchange='celery', task_default_routing_key='celery' to main.py Celery config; diagnostic revealed queue length stayed at 0 after send_task() calls",
    "7.1.80": "Debug Enhancement - Added comprehensive debug logging: Re-run Rules now logs celery_app broker/backend URLs, task state, Redis queue length before/after send_task; worker startup now logs all registered tasks, Redis connection status, all Redis keys, and queue length; added diagnose_celery.sh script for manual Redis/Celery diagnostics",
    "7.1.79": "Critical Fix - Fixed tasks not reaching worker: web service was importing celery_app.py which created duplicate Celery app instance with signal handlers causing broker routing conflict; now creates minimal Celery connection in main.py without importing celery_app module; worker and web now properly share same Redis broker queue",
    "7.1.78": "Enhancement - Replaced slow server-side search with instant client-side JavaScript filtering on SIGMA Rules page (no page reload); auto-enable Windows threat-hunting rules from rules-threat-hunting/windows directory when downloading from SigmaHQ; WARNING: v7.1.76 changes require web service restart (sudo systemctl restart casescope-web) for celery_app import to load and fix Re-run Rules functionality",
    "7.1.77": "Enhancement - Added search functionality to SIGMA Rules page: search box filters rules by title, level, or category with case-insensitive partial matching; includes clear button to reset search; built-in threat hunting rules auto-enabled on first load for immediate use",
    "7.1.76": "Critical Fix - Fixed Celery tasks never reaching worker: main.py was importing tasks directly creating separate disconnected Celery app instances; now imports celery_app and uses send_task() method to queue tasks to the same Redis broker that worker monitors; this fixes file upload indexing, re-index, and re-run rules functionality",
    "7.1.75": "Bugfix - Fixed Celery worker ExecStop error 'Referenced but unset environment variable MAINPID' by replacing ExecStopPost with proper ExecStop using celery control shutdown command; Type=simple doesn't support MAINPID variable",
    "7.1.74": "Bugfix - Fixed SIGMA rules download failing with 'No such file or directory: git' error by using full path /usr/bin/git in subprocess.run call instead of relying on PATH environment variable in web service",
    "7.1.73": "Bugfix - Fixed sigma_rules route using incorrect render_template('sigma_rules.html') call instead of inline render_sigma_rules_page() function; was causing werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError server error due to missing template file and base.html reference to non-existent system_dashboard endpoint",
    "7.1.72": "Enhancement - Improved Re-run Rules functionality: added deletion of existing violations before re-running rules to prevent duplicates, enhanced task queuing with task ID logging and full traceback on errors in main.py, added verbose logging to process_sigma_rules Celery task (task ID, file details, case info, rule processing steps) for easier debugging via journalctl -u casescope-worker -f",
    "7.1.71": "Bugfix - Fixed Re-run Rules progress tracking: added 'Running Rules' status to JavaScript activeFiles detection so progress bars and auto-refresh work when manually re-running SIGMA rules; previously only detected Uploaded/Pending/Counting/Preparing statuses",
    "7.1.70": "Bugfix - Fixed SIGMA navigation menu styling: added missing .menu-item and .menu-title CSS styles to SIGMA Rules and Violations pages' embedded stylesheets; menu links now render as styled buttons instead of plain text links; matches styling of other pages",
    "7.1.69": "Bugfix - Fixed pySigma backend class name: changed OpensearchBackend to OpensearchLuceneBackend in tasks.py for compatibility with pysigma-backend-opensearch 1.0.1; the backend module reorganized class names and OpensearchLuceneBackend is the correct import for Lucene query syntax generation",
    "7.1.68": "Bugfix - Fixed pyparsing dependency version conflict: pinned pyparsing==3.0.9 in requirements.txt to resolve ImportError (cannot import 'List' from pyparsing) that was preventing Celery worker from starting; newer pyparsing versions (3.1.0+) removed the List class that pySigma 0.10.9 depends on",
    "7.1.67": "Feature Complete - Full SIGMA Detection Pipeline: Implemented SigmaHQ rule downloader (downloads 3000+ rules from GitHub via git clone); created comprehensive pySigma field mapping pipeline (70+ field mappings from Sigma standard \u2192 caseScope flattened EVTX structure); built rule execution engine in tasks.py using pySigma OpensearchBackend with custom processing pipeline; automatic SIGMA rule processing after EVTX indexing with violation detection and tracking; created violations viewer page (/violations) with severity filtering (critical/high/medium/low), rule/file filtering, review status tracking, paginated results, expandable violation details showing full event data; violation review system with notes and analyst tracking; added \ud83d\udea8 SIGMA Violations to navigation menu; full integration with existing indexing workflow (Uploaded \u2192 Counting \u2192 Indexing \u2192 Running Rules \u2192 Completed)",

    "7.1.65": "Enhancement - Updated dashboards with real-time statistics: System Dashboard now shows live counts (total cases, files, events, users, storage, violations), Recent Cases and Recent File Uploads sections, active features indicator; Case Dashboard shows case-specific stats (files indexed/processing, total events, storage used, SIGMA violations), replaced placeholder 'Coming Soon' text with working numbers; both dashboards highlight operational features (Case Management \u2713, File Upload \u2713, EVTX Indexing \u2713, Event Search \u2713)",
    "7.1.64": "Bugfix - Completed centralized menu migration: updated System Dashboard, Case Dashboard, and Case Selection pages to use render_sidebar_menu() function; all 6 pages (System Dashboard, Case Dashboard, Case Selection, Upload Files, List Files, Search Events) now use centralized menu ensuring consistent navigation with new SIGMA Rules and Event ID Database menu items visible everywhere",
    "7.1.63": "Enhancement - Added Management menu items: '\ud83d\udccb Update SIGMA Rules' placeholder for future SIGMA rule management interface, '\ud83d\udd04 Update Event ID Database' placeholder for automated Event ID database updates from Ultimate Windows Security Encyclopedia; both items styled as Coming Soon in centralized menu system",
    "7.1.62": "Enhancement - Centralized sidebar menu system: created render_sidebar_menu() function to ensure consistent navigation across all pages, fixes menu items appearing/disappearing bug; expanded Event ID database to 100+ events from Ultimate Windows Security Encyclopedia (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/) including Security events (4624-4781, group management, firewall, Kerberos), System events (1074, 6005-6013, 7034-7045), PowerShell (4103-4106, 800, 403, 600), Defender (1000-5012 - scans, malware, definitions, real-time protection, tamper); fixed query preservation in search box by using parameter copy in build_opensearch_query() so original user query stays visible after clicking field tags",
    "7.1.61": "Enhancement - Added Event Type column with human-friendly descriptions: replaced Channel/Provider columns with single Event Type showing 'Successful Logon', 'Defender Signature Updated', 'Process Created', etc.; added get_event_description() function mapping 50+ common Event IDs to readable descriptions (Security 4624/4625/4688, System 1074/6008, PowerShell 4104, Defender 1151/2000/5007); fallback logic uses provider/channel for unknown events; fixed source_filename field mapping to _casescope_metadata.filename so clicking Source File tag adds correct search query; results table now shows Event ID, Timestamp, Event Type, Source File, Computer (5 columns)",
    "7.1.60": "Enhancement - Implemented multi-field mapping for timeline sorting: System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime now indexed as text (searchable) + date (sortable) + keyword (exact match); EventID, Computer, Channel, Provider also get text + keyword subfields; added create_index_mapping() function that sets up proper field mappings before indexing; search now sorts by timestamp.date subfield (chronological timeline view) with relevance fallback; ALL fields remain fully text-searchable while key fields can also be sorted/filtered; re-index files to get timeline sorting",
    "7.1.59": "Bugfix - Removed timestamp sorting to fix RequestError 400: Text fields cannot be used for sorting in OpenSearch; changed to sort by relevance score (_score) instead, which is more appropriate for forensic searches where users want most relevant results first; all fields remain fully searchable as text for maximum flexibility",
    "7.1.58": "Bugfix - Fixed result display fields showing N/A: Updated field extraction to handle XML attribute notation (System.EventID.#text, System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime, System.Provider.@Name), fixed source filename extraction from _casescope_metadata, updated sort field to use correct timestamp path, updated field mappings for accurate queries, enhanced help documentation with Pro Tips emphasizing all data is searchable as plain text, added practical forensic examples (IPs, file paths, executables)",
