    "7.11.0": "Major Feature - Wazuh-Style Event Discovery Interface: replaced simple clickable fields with professional Wazuh-inspired field table; each field has filter-for (green +), filter-out (orange −), and copy (blue 📋) action buttons; fields organized in clean table with field name and value columns; collapsible nested sections for organized data; hover-revealed action buttons; auto-submits search when filtering; matches professional SIEM UX for forensic investigation",
    "7.10.21": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed custom date range filtering returning 0 results: ROOT CAUSE: wildcard queries in OpenSearch only work on KEYWORD fields, not analyzed TEXT fields; our time filter used 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime:2025-08-26*' but field is text type with tokenization/analysis; TESTING: direct wildcard query on text field returned 0 results; wildcard query on System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime.keyword returned 1,731 results; SOLUTION: updated time filter wildcards to use .keyword subfield; changed 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime:DATE*' to 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime.keyword:DATE*'; OpenSearch auto-creates .keyword subfield for all text fields with exact (non-analyzed) value; FIXES: custom date range now works (24h/7d/30d/custom all functional); tested with 2025-08-24 to 2025-08-26 range successfully finding events; wildcard matching now works because .keyword stores exact timestamp string without analysis",
    "7.10.20": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed field name mappings causing 0 results: ROOT CAUSE: build_opensearch_query() field_mappings used underscore notation (System_EventID_#text, System_Computer, etc.) but flatten_event() in tasks.py stores fields with DOT notation (System.EventID.#text, System.Computer); RESULT: queries like 'EventID:4625' were converted to 'System_EventID_#text:4625' which doesn't exist in index, returning 0 results; SOLUTION: updated all field mappings in main.py to use dot notation matching tasks.py flatten_event(); EventID→System.EventID.#text, Computer→System.Computer, Provider→System.Provider.@Name, TimeCreated→System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime, source_filename→_casescope_metadata.filename; result extraction already had fallbacks for both notations so display continues working; FIXES: EventID:4625 now works, Computer:WORKSTATION01 works, all field-specific searches now target correct indexed fields",
    "7.10.19": "Feature - Enhanced Search UX for Forensic Analysts: ANALYST WORKFLOW: user finds 'bdole' in events, clicks it to add to query, finds EventID 4625, clicks to add 'bdole AND 4625', discovers 'administrator', clicks to build '(bdole OR administrator) AND 4625' - natural investigation flow; CLICKABLE FIELDS: expanded event details now show organized, clickable fields instead of raw JSON; click any field name:value to add to search query; fields auto-organize into collapsible groups (System, EventData, etc.); SEARCH HISTORY: sidebar shows 5 recent searches (click to reload); displays saved searches with custom names; both auto-populate search box on click; UI IMPROVEMENTS: field viewer with syntax highlighting (blue field names, white values); hover effects show fields are clickable; collapsible sections for nested data; clean, organized layout vs overwhelming JSON dump; BENEFITS: faster query building, intuitive workflow, supports iterative investigation, no need to type field names or remember syntax",
    "7.10.18": "Major Simplification - Removed all complex date mapping: USER FEEDBACK: search totally broken after complex mapping attempts; ROOT CAUSE: fighting OpenSearch's auto-detection with complex multi-field mappings was fragile and error-prone; SOLUTION: complete simplification - removed ensure_index_with_mapping() function entirely; let OpenSearch auto-detect all field types (dynamic mapping); removed sort by .date subfield (sort by score only for reliability); simplified time filtering to use wildcard prefix matching on text timestamps (e.g., '2025-08-25*' for single day, OR of wildcards for date ranges); removed all format parameters and range queries on timestamps; BENEFITS: much simpler code, works with existing data, no re-indexing needed, easier to maintain and extend later; TRADEOFFS: no timestamp-based sorting (score-based only), date filtering uses wildcards not true date math (works fine for reasonable ranges)",
    "7.10.17": "Bugfix - Auto-delete indices with wrong mapping on re-index: ISSUE: ensure_index_with_mapping() returned early if index existed, so re-indexing kept old auto-detected mapping (text only, no .date subfield); SOLUTION: added mapping validation in ensure_index_with_mapping(); checks if index has 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime.date' subfield; if missing, automatically deletes index and recreates with proper mapping; ensures ALL re-indexed data gets correct multi-field timestamp mapping; eliminates need for manual index deletion before re-indexing",
    "7.10.16": "Feature - Multi-field timestamp mapping for proper date filtering: ROOT CAUSE: timestamp fields were auto-detected as text (no .date subfield); SOLUTION: added ensure_index_with_mapping() function in tasks.py to create index with explicit mappings before indexing; timestamps now use multi-field mapping: 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime' as text with .date subfield as date type (format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS||yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||strict_date_optional_time); same pattern for 'System_TimeCreated_SystemTime' and '@timestamp'; search queries updated to use '.date' subfield for range filters (e.g., 'System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime.date'); text field remains for full-text search, .date subfield enables proper date math and range queries; existing data will need re-indexing to get date subfields",
    "7.10.15": "Bugfix - Use lexicographic range queries for text timestamp fields: timestamp fields stored as TEXT not DATE type in OpenSearch; removed 'format' parameter from range queries which only works with date-typed fields; use simple lexicographic string comparison with gte/lte operators; ISO 8601-like timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) are naturally sortable as text; query now uses 'gte: 2025-08-25' and 'lte: 2025-08-26 23:59:59.999999' for proper text-based range matching; works because string comparison '2025-08-25 14:05:54' >= '2025-08-25' and <= '2025-08-26 23:59:59.999999'",
    "7.10.14": "Bugfix - Fixed timestamp format mismatch causing 0 results with time filters: OpenSearch stores timestamps as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm+TZ' (e.g., 2025-08-25 14:05:54.201157+00:00) with SPACE not T; changed strftime format from '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' to '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'; updated OpenSearch format pattern from 'yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss' to 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss||yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||strict_date_optional_time'; now supports space-separated date/time format which matches stored timestamps; fixes range query returning 0 results when timestamps are in correct date range",
    "7.10.13": "Bugfix - Fixed datetime parsing for custom time ranges: HTML datetime-local input sends 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM' format (e.g., 2025-08-25T12:00); replaced fromisoformat() with strptime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M') for proper parsing; added try/except error handling with debug logging; fallback to ISO format if strptime fails; added print statements to log parsed start/end times and filter application for debugging; prevents datetime parsing errors causing time filter to be silently ignored",
    "7.10.12": "Bugfix - Fixed time range filtering in search returning 0 results: replaced inefficient wildcard queries with proper OpenSearch range queries on timestamp fields; uses 'range' query with 'gte' and 'lte' operators; supports multiple timestamp field formats (System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime, System_TimeCreated_SystemTime, @timestamp); proper ISO 8601 datetime formatting (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss); works with preset ranges (24h, 7d, 30d) and custom date ranges; datetime parsing for custom ranges using fromisoformat; minimum_should_match: 1 to handle different field names across indices",
    "7.10.11": "Upload Page - Complete professional redesign with full functionality: replaced old broken upload UI with modern drag-and-drop interface; .upload-dropzone with 300px min-height, 3px dashed border, hover states (blue) and dragover states (green with scale animation); .upload-info-card with checkmarks; .file-list with individual .file-item cards showing icon, name, size, and remove button; .file-item-error styling for oversized files; .file-item-remove hover effects (red background, scale transform); .file-list-total showing cumulative size; proper JavaScript handlers for click-to-select, drag-and-drop, file validation (5 file limit, 3GB per file), individual file removal, total size calculation; form validation on submit with loading state; all styled consistently with dark theme; centered layout with 1000px max-width",
    "7.10.10": "Theme - Major styling additions for Search, SIGMA Violations, SIGMA Rules, User Management pages: comprehensive .stats-bar with .stat-item tiles (Total/Critical/High/Medium/Low counts with color-coded values); .filter-bar for dropdowns; .search-box and .search-actions layout; collapsible .help-box for query syntax; .field-tag for clickable fields; .pagination styling; .severity-badge and .review-badge; .btn-action variants (view/review/edit/delete); .violation-details expandable panels; .detail-grid for violation info; .rule-row and .tag styling; .role-badge and .status-badge for users; .modal and .modal-content for dialogs; comprehensive .flash-message styling for all alert types; proper tables, buttons, forms consistent across all pages",
    "7.10.9": "Theme - Fixed upload area styling: proper centering with display flex, flex-direction column, align-items center, justify-content center; min-height 300px for large drop zone; padding 4rem 2rem; proper drag and drop visual feedback (hover: blue border, dragover: green border with solid line); upload-icon 4rem with proper spacing; upload-text and upload-subtext properly centered and sized; selected-files display with flex layout; upload-info box with proper styling; max-width 900px container; all upload components now properly styled and functional",
    "7.10.8": "Theme - UX improvements: header user info now aligned to far right (added display flex and justify-content flex-end to .header, margin-left auto to .user-info); removed underline from all link hovers (changed text-decoration underline to none on hover for regular links and tile links); cleaner, more professional appearance",
    "7.10.7": "Theme - Refined buttons to be less cartoony; reduced padding from 0.75rem 1.5rem to 0.5rem 1rem; smaller font 0.875rem (was 0.9rem); border-radius 6px (was 8px); added subtle 1px borders; better hover states with shadow; active state feedback; included a.btn for link buttons; proper link styling for non-button links (blue, underline on hover); logout button matches new style; btn-sm variant for smaller buttons; all buttons now consistent and professional",
    "7.10.6": "Theme - Hybrid approach: v7.0 colors + main.py HTML structure; v7.0 used app-container/main-container/nav-item but main.py uses sidebar/main-content/menu-item; created CSS that styles main.py structure with v7.0 colors; body flex wrap for sidebar+main-content+footer; fixed .tiles grid for dashboard cards; footer width 100% outside main-content; proper scrolling; menu-item/menu-title styled; all v7.0 colors preserved (#0f172a bg, #1e293b cards, #10b981 green, #3b82f6 blue); working with actual HTML not assumed structure",
    "7.10.5": "Theme - Imported v7.0 style.css (1766 lines) and adapted for render-based system; converted all CSS variables to actual color values (#0f172a, #1e293b, #334155, etc.); removed :root variable definitions; kept all v7.0 styling (sidebar, nav, buttons, tables, cards, badges, forms, alerts); adapted for inline <style> injection; matches proven working v7.0 design exactly; no more guessing - using actual working CSS from v7.0 branch",
    "7.10.4": "Bugfix - Fixed theme.py CSS to match actual HTML structure used in main.py; v7.10.0 rebuild used wrong class names (page-container instead of sidebar/main-content); HTML structure is <body><div class=sidebar><div class=main-content> not wrapped in page-container; fixed all CSS selectors to match: .sidebar, .main-content, .header, .content, .footer, .menu-item, .menu-title; theme now renders correctly; based on actual HTML not assumed structure",
    "7.10.3": "Cleanup - Archived 9 development/testing scripts to archive/dev-tools/; moved test scripts (simple_sigma_test.py, test_one_rule.py, test_rerun_rules.py, test_sigma_direct.py, diagnose_sigma_matching.py); moved debug scripts (check_index_fields.sh, check_sigma_logs.sh, diagnose_celery.sh, commit_changes.sh); kept user-facing utilities (enable_*.py, show_enabled_rules.py, check_enabled_rules.py); kept core app files (main.py, tasks.py, celery_app.py, wsgi.py, theme.py); kept installer and migrations; root directory now contains only production-necessary files; clean, organized structure",
    "7.10.2": "Cleanup - Archived orphaned v7.0 theme files to archive/v7.0-orphaned/ directory; moved static/css/style.css (1766 lines, unused); moved static/js/main.js (750 lines, not needed); moved templates/ directory (15 HTML files, not used by render-based system); eliminated confusion; clean directory structure; theme.py is definitively the sole CSS source; static/css/ and static/js/ now empty (no conflicts possible)",

    "7.3.0": "Feature - User Management System; added /users route (admin only) with create/edit/delete functionality; create user with username/email/password/role validation; edit user email/role/status with optional password reset; delete user with protections (cannot delete self or last admin); user table with role badges (green/blue/orange) and active/inactive status indicators; modal dialogs for create/edit actions; password minimum 8 characters; roles: administrator/analyst/read-only; enabled User Management menu item replacing Coming Soon placeholder",
    "7.2.38": "UI Bugfix - Fixed button styling on case dashboard render function; added proper gradient backgrounds, box shadows, border none, cursor pointer, and font weight to Re-index All Files and Re-run All Rules buttons; wrapped buttons in div containers with margin-top for better spacing; matches styling of other action buttons",
    "7.2.37": "UI Enhancement - Removed Active Features tile and green installation banner from system dashboard; enabled Update Event ID Database menu item with user notice to re-index after updates; replaced Manage Rules button on case dashboard with Re-run All Rules button; added Re-index All Files button to Events tile; added both bulk action buttons (Re-index All Files and Re-run All Rules) to List Files page header; created API endpoints /api/reindex-all-files and /api/rerun-all-rules for bulk operations",
    "7.2.36": "Enhancement - Updated system dashboard to reflect all implemented features; changed version from 7.1 to 7.2; updated Active Features tile to show SIGMA Rule Processing (Chainsaw) and Real-time Progress Tracking as operational; enhanced success banner to showcase EVTX Indexing with Event Type Descriptions, SIGMA Rule Processing with 3000+ rules, Violation Detection & Filtering; added SIGMA rules management to Quick Actions",
    "7.2.35": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed search results not displaying when violations checkbox checked; filenames with special characters like '%4' broke HTML rendering; added HTML escaping for source_file, computer, and event_type fields; added traceback logging to exception handler for better debugging",
    "7.2.34": "Bugfix - Fixed UnboundLocalError for violations_only on GET requests; v7.2.33 only initialized violations_only inside POST block causing error on initial page load; moved violations_only=False initialization before request.method check",
    "7.2.33": "Bugfix - Fixed render_search_page missing violations_only parameter; v7.2.32 added violations_only variable reference but didn't add it to function signature; caused NameError when loading search page; added violations_only parameter with default False to render_search_page and updated call site",
    "7.2.32": "UI Enhancement - Preserve SIGMA violations checkbox state across pagination; checkbox now stays checked when navigating between pages; added checked attribute based on violations_only variable",

    "7.2.30": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed duplicate bulk_index_events function and event_type extraction; user logs showed event_type='Unknown Event' and document_missing_exception during enrichment; root cause: tasks.py had TWO bulk_index_events definitions (lines 364 and 1034); Python uses last definition which DIDN'T include hash-based _id generation causing OpenSearch to auto-generate IDs; enrichment failed because it used hash IDs that didn't match; deleted second function; also fixed get_event_description extraction to handle both dot and underscore notation (System.EventID.#text vs System_EventID_#text); event_type now shows correct descriptions like 'Defender History Deleted' and enrichment uses same hash-based IDs as indexing",
    "7.2.29": "Critical Bugfix - FINAL FIX for event enrichment; user logs showed continued 0 hits on _casescope_metadata_record_number queries after v7.2.27/7.2.28; root cause: we kept trying different field names but NONE exist in flattened structure; solution: use EXACT SAME hash-based doc ID generation as indexing does; indexing creates doc_id = sha256(f'{file_id}_{record_num}')[:16]; modified enrich_events_with_detections to take file_id parameter and generate identical hash; removed all field-based queries; violations checkbox now works because enrichment succeeds; Event Type search works after re-index populates event_type field",
