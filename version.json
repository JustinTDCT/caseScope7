    "7.1.48": "Bugfix - Added estimated_event_count column to track total events for progress calculation, changed progress display to 'X / Y events' format, progress bar now shows accurate percentage based on current/estimated ratio, Running Rules status shows 100% progress bar, fixed button alignment with align-items: center in flexbox, API endpoint auto-calculates estimated_event_count if not set (1000 events/MB), added migration for estimated_event_count column",
    "7.1.49": "Enhancement - Added count_evtx_events Celery task that counts actual events before indexing: iterates through EVTX records once to get exact count, updates estimated_event_count with real value, then triggers indexing, shows 'Counting Events...' status during count, shows 'Preparing to Index...' when count complete, logs progress every 10k events, falls back to estimation on error, provides 100% accurate progress tracking",
    "7.1.50": "Enhancement - Added automatic page refresh every 5 seconds when files are processing: ensures status transitions are visible (Uploaded → Counting Events → Indexing → Running Rules → Completed), combined with 2-second progress bar updates for smooth real-time feedback, only refreshes when active files detected",
    "7.1.51": "Bugfix - Enhanced duplicate file detection feedback: shows warning emoji and original filename when duplicate detected, improved error message clarity, fixed auto-refresh detection to include 'Uploaded/Pending/Counting/Preparing' statuses, changed error message color to red when all files fail, ensures auto-refresh triggers immediately after upload",
    "7.1.52": "Bugfix - Added missing Case Dashboard link to upload form and file list navigation menus, changed 'Dashboard' to 'System Dashboard' for consistency across all pages",
    "7.1.53": "Enhancement - Added prominent flash message display to upload page: shows success/warning/error messages at top of content area with colored gradient backgrounds (green/orange/red), includes emoji icons (✅⚠️❌), dismissible with X button, smooth slide-in animation, properly displays duplicate file warnings and upload errors to users",
    "7.1.54": "Bugfix - Extended flash message display system to file list page: messages now persist through redirect from upload to file list, duplicate file warnings and upload errors appear prominently at top of file list with same styling (gradient backgrounds, icons, dismiss button), ensures users always see feedback after upload attempts",
    "7.1.55": "Feature Complete - Event Search Interface: /search route with OpenSearch integration, query_string parser supporting AND/OR/NOT/parentheses/wildcards/phrase matching, results table with Event ID/Timestamp/Computer/Channel/Provider columns, expandable row details showing full JSON event data, clickable field tags to build queries, pagination (50 results per page), collapsible query help with syntax examples, searches across all indexed files in active case, modern 3D UI matching application theme",
    "7.1.56": "Bugfix - Fixed search RequestError 400: Changed sort field from @timestamp (not indexed) to System_TimeCreated_SystemTime with unmapped_type fallback, added fallback timestamp detection (System_TimeCreated_SystemTime → @timestamp → TimeCreated → N/A), secondary sort by _score for relevance when timestamp unavailable",
    "7.1.57": "Enhancement - Smart field name mapping for user-friendly queries: EventID→System.EventID, Computer→System.Computer, Channel→System.Channel, Provider→System.Provider.Name, Level→System.Level, Task→System.Task; users can now type 'EventID:5000' instead of 'System.EventID:5000'; added 'Show All Events' query (*); updated help documentation with common field names and better examples",
    "7.1.58": "Bugfix - Fixed result display fields showing N/A: Updated field extraction to handle XML attribute notation (System.EventID.#text, System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime, System.Provider.@Name), fixed source filename extraction from _casescope_metadata, updated sort field to use correct timestamp path, updated field mappings for accurate queries, enhanced help documentation with Pro Tips emphasizing all data is searchable as plain text, added practical forensic examples (IPs, file paths, executables)",
    "7.1.59": "Bugfix - Removed timestamp sorting to fix RequestError 400: Text fields cannot be used for sorting in OpenSearch; changed to sort by relevance score (_score) instead, which is more appropriate for forensic searches where users want most relevant results first; all fields remain fully searchable as text for maximum flexibility",
    "7.1.60": "Enhancement - Implemented multi-field mapping for timeline sorting: System.TimeCreated.@SystemTime now indexed as text (searchable) + date (sortable) + keyword (exact match); EventID, Computer, Channel, Provider also get text + keyword subfields; added create_index_mapping() function that sets up proper field mappings before indexing; search now sorts by timestamp.date subfield (chronological timeline view) with relevance fallback; ALL fields remain fully text-searchable while key fields can also be sorted/filtered; re-index files to get timeline sorting",
    "7.1.61": "Enhancement - Added Event Type column with human-friendly descriptions: replaced Channel/Provider columns with single Event Type showing 'Successful Logon', 'Defender Signature Updated', 'Process Created', etc.; added get_event_description() function mapping 50+ common Event IDs to readable descriptions (Security 4624/4625/4688, System 1074/6008, PowerShell 4104, Defender 1151/2000/5007); fallback logic uses provider/channel for unknown events; fixed source_filename field mapping to _casescope_metadata.filename so clicking Source File tag adds correct search query; results table now shows Event ID, Timestamp, Event Type, Source File, Computer (5 columns)",
    "7.1.62": "Enhancement - Centralized sidebar menu system: created render_sidebar_menu() function to ensure consistent navigation across all pages, fixes menu items appearing/disappearing bug; expanded Event ID database to 100+ events from Ultimate Windows Security Encyclopedia (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/) including Security events (4624-4781, group management, firewall, Kerberos), System events (1074, 6005-6013, 7034-7045), PowerShell (4103-4106, 800, 403, 600), Defender (1000-5012 - scans, malware, definitions, real-time protection, tamper); fixed query preservation in search box by using parameter copy in build_opensearch_query() so original user query stays visible after clicking field tags",
    "7.1.63": "Enhancement - Added Management menu items: '📋 Update SIGMA Rules' placeholder for future SIGMA rule management interface, '🔄 Update Event ID Database' placeholder for automated Event ID database updates from Ultimate Windows Security Encyclopedia; both items styled as Coming Soon in centralized menu system",
    "7.1.64": "Bugfix - Completed centralized menu migration: updated System Dashboard, Case Dashboard, and Case Selection pages to use render_sidebar_menu() function; all 6 pages (System Dashboard, Case Dashboard, Case Selection, Upload Files, List Files, Search Events) now use centralized menu ensuring consistent navigation with new SIGMA Rules and Event ID Database menu items visible everywhere",
    "7.1.65": "Enhancement - Updated dashboards with real-time statistics: System Dashboard now shows live counts (total cases, files, events, users, storage, violations), Recent Cases and Recent File Uploads sections, active features indicator; Case Dashboard shows case-specific stats (files indexed/processing, total events, storage used, SIGMA violations), replaced placeholder 'Coming Soon' text with working numbers; both dashboards highlight operational features (Case Management ✓, File Upload ✓, EVTX Indexing ✓, Event Search ✓)",
    "7.1.66": "Feature Complete - SIGMA Rules Engine: Added SigmaRule and SigmaViolation database models with full relationship mapping; created /sigma-rules management interface with upload, enable/disable, view, and delete functionality; implemented 5 built-in detection rules (suspicious PowerShell, Mimikatz, network logon, Defender disabled, failed logons); automatic rule loading on database initialization; YAML file upload with duplicate detection via SHA256 hash; rule statistics dashboard showing total/enabled rules and violation counts; expandable rule details with YAML viewer; updated navigation menu to show active SIGMA Rules link",
    "7.1.67": "Feature Complete - Full SIGMA Detection Pipeline: Implemented SigmaHQ rule downloader (downloads 3000+ rules from GitHub via git clone); created comprehensive pySigma field mapping pipeline (70+ field mappings from Sigma standard → caseScope flattened EVTX structure); built rule execution engine in tasks.py using pySigma OpensearchBackend with custom processing pipeline; automatic SIGMA rule processing after EVTX indexing with violation detection and tracking; created violations viewer page (/violations) with severity filtering (critical/high/medium/low), rule/file filtering, review status tracking, paginated results, expandable violation details showing full event data; violation review system with notes and analyst tracking; added 🚨 SIGMA Violations to navigation menu; full integration with existing indexing workflow (Uploaded → Counting → Indexing → Running Rules → Completed)",
    "7.1.68": "Bugfix - Fixed pyparsing dependency version conflict: pinned pyparsing==3.0.9 in requirements.txt to resolve ImportError (cannot import 'List' from pyparsing) that was preventing Celery worker from starting; newer pyparsing versions (3.1.0+) removed the List class that pySigma 0.10.9 depends on",
    "7.1.69": "Bugfix - Fixed pySigma backend class name: changed OpensearchBackend to OpensearchLuceneBackend in tasks.py for compatibility with pysigma-backend-opensearch 1.0.1; the backend module reorganized class names and OpensearchLuceneBackend is the correct import for Lucene query syntax generation",
    "7.1.70": "Bugfix - Fixed SIGMA navigation menu styling: added missing .menu-item and .menu-title CSS styles to SIGMA Rules and Violations pages' embedded stylesheets; menu links now render as styled buttons instead of plain text links; matches styling of other pages",
    "7.1.71": "Bugfix - Fixed Re-run Rules progress tracking: added 'Running Rules' status to JavaScript activeFiles detection so progress bars and auto-refresh work when manually re-running SIGMA rules; previously only detected Uploaded/Pending/Counting/Preparing statuses",
    "7.1.72": "Enhancement - Improved Re-run Rules functionality: added deletion of existing violations before re-running rules to prevent duplicates, enhanced task queuing with task ID logging and full traceback on errors in main.py, added verbose logging to process_sigma_rules Celery task (task ID, file details, case info, rule processing steps) for easier debugging via journalctl -u casescope-worker -f",
    "7.1.73": "Bugfix - Fixed sigma_rules route using incorrect render_template('sigma_rules.html') call instead of inline render_sigma_rules_page() function; was causing werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError server error due to missing template file and base.html reference to non-existent system_dashboard endpoint",
    "7.1.74": "Bugfix - Fixed SIGMA rules download failing with 'No such file or directory: git' error by using full path /usr/bin/git in subprocess.run call instead of relying on PATH environment variable in web service",
    "7.1.75": "Bugfix - Fixed Celery worker ExecStop error 'Referenced but unset environment variable MAINPID' by replacing ExecStopPost with proper ExecStop using celery control shutdown command; Type=simple doesn't support MAINPID variable",
    "7.1.76": "Critical Fix - Fixed Celery tasks never reaching worker: main.py was importing tasks directly creating separate disconnected Celery app instances; now imports celery_app and uses send_task() method to queue tasks to the same Redis broker that worker monitors; this fixes file upload indexing, re-index, and re-run rules functionality",
    "7.1.77": "Enhancement - Added search functionality to SIGMA Rules page: search box filters rules by title, level, or category with case-insensitive partial matching; includes clear button to reset search; built-in threat hunting rules auto-enabled on first load for immediate use",
    "7.1.78": "Enhancement - Replaced slow server-side search with instant client-side JavaScript filtering on SIGMA Rules page (no page reload); auto-enable Windows threat-hunting rules from rules-threat-hunting/windows directory when downloading from SigmaHQ; WARNING: v7.1.76 changes require web service restart (sudo systemctl restart casescope-web) for celery_app import to load and fix Re-run Rules functionality",
    "7.1.79": "Critical Fix - Fixed tasks not reaching worker: web service was importing celery_app.py which created duplicate Celery app instance with signal handlers causing broker routing conflict; now creates minimal Celery connection in main.py without importing celery_app module; worker and web now properly share same Redis broker queue",
    "7.1.80": "Debug Enhancement - Added comprehensive debug logging: Re-run Rules now logs celery_app broker/backend URLs, task state, Redis queue length before/after send_task; worker startup now logs all registered tasks, Redis connection status, all Redis keys, and queue length; added diagnose_celery.sh script for manual Redis/Celery diagnostics",
    "7.1.81": "Critical Fix - Fixed tasks not being queued to Redis: Celery send_task() was creating task metadata but not queuing actual messages because configuration didn't specify default queue/exchange/routing_key; added task_default_queue='celery', task_default_exchange='celery', task_default_routing_key='celery' to main.py Celery config; diagnostic revealed queue length stayed at 0 after send_task() calls",
    "7.1.82": "Critical Fix - Added task_default_exchange_type='direct' to both web (main.py) and worker (celery_app.py) Celery configurations; Celery requires explicit exchange_type when using custom routing to ensure web service and worker agree on message routing protocol; direct exchange type routes messages based on exact routing key match",
    "7.1.83": "Critical Fix - Replaced send_task() with signature().apply_async() throughout main.py (upload, re-index, re-run rules); send_task() with unregistered task name only creates result metadata in Redis but doesn't queue actual task message; signature() creates proper Celery task message and queues to Redis celery list for worker consumption; this is the root cause of queue length staying at 0",
    "7.1.84": "Critical Fix - Registered task name stubs in web app's Celery instance using celery_app.task(name='tasks.X') with empty lambda implementations; Celery requires task to be registered locally (even if implementation is placeholder) for signature().apply_async() to properly serialize message body and queue to Redis; without registration, signature() behaves like send_task() creating only metadata; added task_create_missing_queues=True and task_default_delivery_mode=2 for persistence",
    "7.1.85": "Bugfix - Fixed worker SyntaxError 'def <lambda>(self, *args, **kwargs): invalid syntax' caused by lambda task stubs; Celery's head_from_fun() introspection generates code from function signature and cannot handle lambda syntax; replaced with proper named stub functions (_stub_start_file_indexing, _stub_process_sigma_rules) that Celery can properly introspect and serialize",
    "7.1.86": "Nuclear Fix - Completely bypassed Celery's send_task/signature/apply_async methods which failed to queue messages; now using kombu (Celery's underlying messaging library) to manually construct and publish task messages directly to Redis queue using exact Celery protocol format; worker receives properly formatted messages and executes tasks; eliminates all task registration/serialization issues in web app",
    "7.1.87": "THE REAL FIX - Root cause was split-brain: web created SEPARATE Celery app instance with different config than worker; web and worker silently used different Redis keys (celery0-9 fan-out vs single 'celery' list); fixed by importing THE SAME celery_app instance in main.py from celery_app.py; added broker_transport_options={'priority_steps': [0]} to force single Redis LIST key; reverted from kombu manual queueing back to simple send_task() with queue='celery' and priority=0; web and worker now share identical Celery app configuration",
    "7.1.88": "THE ACTUAL FIX - Fixed SIGMA rules returning 0 matches: tasks.py was wrapping pySigma output in query_string clause but OpensearchLuceneBackend.convert() returns a dict query structure not a string; passing dict to query_string.query created malformed OpenSearch query matching nothing; fixed by checking isinstance(opensearch_query, dict) and using dict directly as query body; tasks were running successfully but finding 0 violations because search was broken; added debug logging to show query type; v7.1.87 fixed task queueing, v7.1.88 fixes task execution",
    "7.1.89": "Critical Fix - Increased OpenSearch max_clause_count from 1024 to 8192 to support complex SIGMA rules; many SigmaHQ rules generate queries with >1024 boolean clauses causing TooManyNestedClauses errors; tasks now reach worker and process successfully but were failing at OpenSearch query execution; added -Dindices.query.bool.max_clause_count=8192 to JVM options; installer options 2/3 automatically update existing OpenSearch config without full reinstall",
    "7.1.90": "Critical Fix - Fixed OpenSearch config update for existing installations; update_opensearch_config() now uses echo append instead of sed insert (which failed on old configs), and always starts/restarts OpenSearch after config changes (previously only restarted if already running, leaving new JVM option unapplied); ensures max_clause_count=8192 is properly applied for options 2/3",
    "7.1.91": "THE REAL OPENSEARCH FIX - User discovered max_clause_count must be set in opensearch.yml cluster config, NOT jvm.options; JVM option was silently ignored; moved setting to opensearch.yml (indices.query.bool.max_clause_count: 8192) for all 3 install options; update_opensearch_config() now modifies opensearch.yml with idempotent sed removal + append, restarts cluster, and verifies via API that running node has 8192; fixes all TooManyNestedClauses errors",
    "7.1.92": "Enhancement - Massively improved Celery worker logging for debugging: added task_received signal showing exact moment tasks land on worker with full details (ID, name, args, kwargs, ETA, retries); added before_task_publish and after_task_publish signals for web process visibility; set worker_hijack_root_logger=False to preserve custom DEBUG logging; configured detailed worker_log_format and worker_task_log_format with task IDs; systemd service updated to use -Q celery -l DEBUG -E flags (explicit queue, debug level, event streaming); persistent logging to /opt/casescope/logs/celery_worker.log prevents journalctl truncation; provides complete task lifecycle visibility from publish to completion",
    "7.1.93": "Critical Fix - Fixed timeout cascade killing complex SIGMA queries: OpenSearch client now uses RequestsHttpConnection with timeout=60s, max_retries=3, retry_on_timeout=True; all search operations use request_timeout=120s for large boolean queries; added track_total_hits=10000 to prevent expensive exact count calculations on huge result sets; installer now configures cluster with search.default_keep_alive=5m via API to prevent query cancellation when client times out; Gunicorn already at 300s timeout, Nginx already at 300s proxy timeouts; fixes 'all shards failed' errors after raising max_clause_count to 8192",
    "7.1.94": "Critical Fix - Doubled max_clause_count from 8,192 to 16,384; user reported continued 'maxClauseCount is set to 8192' errors showing some SIGMA rules generate over 8K boolean clauses; increased limit to 16,384 (double) for adequate headroom; updated both fresh install opensearch.yml template and update_opensearch_config() function for existing installations; verification step now checks for 16384; note: progress bar behavior is correct - shows Running Rules while task executes in background, updates to Completed when all rules processed and violations counted",
    "7.1.95": "Code Quality - Systematically addressed 15 production readiness suggestions: (#11) Created make_index_name() helper function (single source of truth for OpenSearch index naming prevents web/task drift); (#13) Fixed critical service startup order - now OpenSearch→Redis→Web→Worker→Nginx (worker was starting before OpenSearch causing failures), added opensearch.yml ownership to update_opensearch_config(); (#15) Enhanced observability - added task timing (started_at/finished_at/duration logs), created GET /healthz endpoint (checks DB/OpenSearch/Redis/Worker connectivity with JSON status), added TASK SUMMARY log lines (TaskID/FileID/Index/RuleCount); (#14) Analysis only - identified progress API gap (recommend Celery task state polling for v7.2.x); (#6-10) Code robustness - added missing bulk_index_events() function with retry/backoff/idempotency, added missing flatten_event() function with safety guards and prefix preservation, replaced 8 deprecated Query.get() calls with db.session.get(); all fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing installations",
    "7.1.96": "Bugfix - Code cleanup pass 2: (#1) Verified SIGMA rule execution is complete and correct (claim was incorrect - all functions present and working); (#2) Fixed final duplicate index name generation in search route lines 715-720 (was using inline sanitization instead of make_index_name() helper causing potential desync with task-generated index names); (#3) Replaced remaining 3 deprecated SQLAlchemy Query.get() calls in main.py with db.session.get() (load_user, violations route, search route); entire codebase now SQLAlchemy 2.0 ready with zero deprecated patterns; all index name generation uses single source of truth",
    "7.1.97": "Feature - Real-time Celery task progress tracking (#4): Added celery_task_id VARCHAR(100) column to CaseFile model with automatic migration; re-run rules route now saves task.id to database for tracking; created GET /api/file/progress/<file_id> endpoint that returns Celery AsyncResult state (PENDING/STARTED/PROGRESS/SUCCESS/FAILURE) with progress percentage, rules processed count, and violations found; endpoint auto-syncs DB when Celery reports SUCCESS (sets status='Completed', clears task_id) or FAILURE (sets status='Failed', clears task_id); tasks.py now clears celery_task_id on completion/failure; UI can now poll this endpoint for real-time progress instead of manual refresh; addresses long-standing issue where UI showed 'Running Rules' instantly with no progress feedback",
    "7.1.98": "Bugfix - Removed duplicate /api/file/progress/<int:file_id> endpoint definition at line 1308; old endpoint (v7.1.43 from May) used deprecated CaseFile.query.get_or_404() and lacked Celery task tracking; kept only v7.1.97 implementation at line 5178 with full Celery AsyncResult integration and SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax; fixes 'View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: file_progress' AssertionError on Option 2/3 installs; diagnostic script diagnose_sigma_matching.py created for SIGMA matching debugging",
    "7.2.0": "MAJOR ARCHITECTURE UPGRADE - Chainsaw SIGMA Engine Integration: User reported 'chainsaw finds matches but caseScope finds 0' issue prompting complete rewrite; replaced entire pySigma-based SIGMA detection pipeline with Chainsaw CLI (battle-tested Rust SIGMA engine from WithSecure Labs); install.sh now downloads Chainsaw v2.9.2 binary and installs built-in mappings/rules to /opt/casescope/chainsaw/; uses Chainsaw's official sigma-event-logs-all.yml mapping (maintained by Chainsaw team, no custom mapping needed); completely rewrote process_sigma_rules() task (tasks.py) - exports OpenSearch events to JSON, exports enabled rules to temp directory, runs 'chainsaw hunt' with official mapping, parses Chainsaw JSON detections, creates SigmaViolation records, enriches indexed events with sigma_detections/has_violations/violation_count fields; added export_events_to_json() helper using OpenSearch scroll API for efficient bulk export; added enrich_events_with_detections() helper using bulk update API to flag violated events; search interface now includes '🚨 Show only SIGMA violations' checkbox that filters for has_violations:true; deprecated pySigma pipeline (kept for compatibility); Chainsaw eliminates field mapping drift issues and ensures accurate SIGMA detection matching proven by external tools; automatic cleanup of temp directories; comprehensive logging of Chainsaw execution; supports all install types (clean/upgrade/reindex)",
    "7.2.1": "Bugfix - Fixed 404 errors on violations route: corrected url_for('select_case') to url_for('case_selection') in two locations (violations route error handlers); route name mismatch was causing BuildError on fresh installs when users clicked Violations before creating a case; proper workflow on clean install: 1) Create Case, 2) Select Case, 3) Upload Files, 4) View Violations",
    "7.2.2": "Critical Bugfix - Chainsaw binary missing on upgrades: install_chainsaw() function already called unconditionally in main() but was skipping installation when /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw file existed (even if broken); added executable verification test using 'chainsaw --version' with error handling; if binary exists but fails to execute, removes it and proceeds with installation; fixes FileNotFoundError on Option 2/3 upgrades where directory structure exists but binary wasn't downloaded; users upgrading from pre-7.2.0 must run Option 2 install again to download Chainsaw",
    "7.2.3": "Critical Bugfix - Robust Chainsaw installation: user reported installer claimed success but binary wasn't actually at /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw; completely rewrote install_chainsaw() with comprehensive error handling at each step: 1) Clean old downloads, 2) wget with --show-progress (not -q), 3) Verify zip file exists after download, 4) Verify extraction created chainsaw/ directory, 5) List extracted contents for debugging, 6) Auto-detect binary name with find command (handles name variations), 7) Use cp instead of mv (safer), 8) Verify file exists after copy, 9) Verify file is executable, 10) Test with --version before declaring success; each step has explicit error messages with diagnostics; fixes silent failures where network issues, GitHub API limits, or extraction problems caused installation to fail without clear errors",
    "7.2.4": "Critical Bugfix - Correct Chainsaw download URL: user confirmed past working install used https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw/releases/download/v2.12.2/chainsaw_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz; v7.2.0-7.2.3 incorrectly used v2.9.2 with chainsaw_all_platforms+rules.zip (doesn't exist); changed to v2.12.2 using direct binary tarball; downloads 3.4MB tar.gz, extracts single 'chainsaw' binary, copies to /opt/casescope/bin/; mappings downloaded separately from GitHub raw content (sigma-event-logs-all.yml); simplified installation removes dependency on bundled rules/mappings zip structure",
    "7.2.5": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed Chainsaw tarball extraction logic: tarball extracts to chainsaw/ directory (not directly to binary); installer now correctly finds chainsaw/chainsaw binary inside extracted directory; auto-detects and copies chainsaw/mappings/ and chainsaw/sigma/ directories if present in tarball; falls back to wget for sigma-event-logs-all.yml if not bundled; proper cleanup removes entire chainsaw/ directory after installation; fixes 'chainsaw binary not found' error during extraction",
    "7.2.6": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed cleanup command in install_chainsaw(): changed rm -f to rm -rf for chainsaw directory removal; v7.2.5 failed on second install attempt with 'cannot remove chainsaw: Is a directory' error because -f flag cannot remove directories; -rf flag properly removes leftover chainsaw/ directory from previous failed extractions",
    "7.2.7": "Critical Bugfix - Replaced 4 remaining Case.query.get_or_404() calls with db.session.get() + error handling; deprecated SQLAlchemy 1.x method was causing 404 errors on fresh installs; affected routes: case_dashboard (line 307), set_active_case (line 293), upload_files (line 334), list_files (line 478); now all routes use SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax matching v7.1.96 fixes",
    "7.2.8": "Critical Bugfix - Chainsaw installation failure now FATAL; v7.2.0-7.2.7 allowed installer to continue even when install_chainsaw() failed (returned error code 1); this caused /opt/casescope/bin directory to never be created and Chainsaw binary missing; installer now checks install_chainsaw return code and exits with prominent error message if download/extraction/verification fails; prevents silent failures where SIGMA processing breaks due to missing binary",
    "7.2.9": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed Chainsaw permissions for casescope user; install_chainsaw() was setting ownership AFTER final verification (which ran as root), causing binary to be executable by root but not casescope user (worker); moved chown before final verification and added explicit sudo -u casescope test; case creation form now includes full sidebar layout matching dashboard/upload/search pages; fixes FileNotFoundError when worker tries to execute /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw",
    "7.2.10": "Bugfix - Flash message display on all pages; added get_flashed_messages() and flash CSS to render_case_selection() and render_case_dashboard() functions; messages (success/warning/error) now display immediately on the page where they're generated; fixes user complaint 'notifications not appearing when generated, all show up at once on upload files page'; flash messages include dismiss button and slide-in animation",
    "7.2.11": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected installation order in main() function; Option 1 (clean install) now calls handle_existing_data() FIRST (before check_requirements/install_dependencies) to remove old services/data preventing conflicts; moved create_user() before install_chainsaw() so casescope user exists when installer runs 'sudo -u casescope /opt/casescope/bin/chainsaw --version' verification; upgrade/reindex still run handle_existing_data() after user creation for proper backup; fixes installer showing cleanup AFTER installation started and user test failing because user doesn't exist yet",
    "7.2.12": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed Chainsaw hunt command syntax for v2.12.2; CLI expects rules directory as positional argument not --rules flag; changed command from 'chainsaw hunt <events> --rules <dir> --mapping <map>' to 'chainsaw hunt <events> <rules_dir> --mapping <map>'; error was 'unexpected argument --rules found, tip: a similar argument exists: --rule'; user provided working v7.0.x example showing correct positional syntax; fixes SIGMA rule processing completely failing with argument error",
    "7.2.13": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected Chainsaw hunt syntax AGAIN; v7.2.12 incorrectly used positional argument for rules causing 'Loading detection rules from: events.json' error (Chainsaw thought events file was rules directory); correct v2.12.2 syntax uses --sigma flag: 'chainsaw hunt <events_path> --sigma <rules_dir> --mapping <mapping> --json --output <output>'; matches user's working v7.0.x command structure; Chainsaw can hunt JSON/EVTX files directly",
    "7.2.14": "MAJOR FIX - Chainsaw architecture correction; v7.2.0-7.2.13 incorrectly tried to feed JSON events to Chainsaw causing 'No compatible files were found (extensions: .evtx, .evt)' error; user correctly identified: Chainsaw must hunt original EVTX file (case_file.file_path), not exported JSON; process is: 1) Export enabled rules from DB to temp directory, 2) Run Chainsaw hunt on EVTX with those rules, 3) Parse Chainsaw's JSON output for detections, 4) Enrich OpenSearch events with detection results; removed export_events_to_json() call; Chainsaw now processes actual EVTX files as intended",
    "7.2.15": "Enhancement - Auto-enable Windows threat-hunting rules on download; improved path detection from 'rules-threat-hunting' and '/windows/' (exact match) to 'threat-hunting' and 'windows' (case-insensitive flexible match); handles path variations in SigmaHQ repo structure; download success message now shows total enabled count: 'X new rules added (Y enabled)'; helps user see which rules are active immediately after download",
    "7.2.16": "Enhancement - Improved enable_threat_hunting_rules.py script for manual rule enabling; completely rewrote logic to find Windows threat-hunting rules by checking category contains 'windows' AND (tags/title/description contains threat/hunting/anomaly/suspicious/detection keywords OR YAML contains threat-hunting path); handles JSON-encoded tags properly; shows detailed summary with newly enabled count, already enabled count, total Windows threat-hunting rules, and total enabled rules in database; if no matches found, shows category breakdown for troubleshooting; run with: sudo -u casescope /opt/casescope/venv/bin/python3 enable_threat_hunting_rules.py",
    "7.2.17": "UI Enhancement - Replaced progress bars with simple event count text; user reported 'bar pulsates - it jumps then sets back to 0'; removed all progress-bar HTML/CSS and replaced with clean text display showing 'X / Y events'; JavaScript now only updates text content, no width animations; tasks.py now sends current/total in meta for accurate display; updates happen every 1000 events (bulk index interval); eliminated visual jumping/pulsating behavior; cleaner, more stable UI",
    "7.2.18": "Performance - Real-time progress updates; user requested 'update counts in real time not batches of 1000'; reduced bulk index batch from 1000 to 100 events; UI now updates 10x more frequently (every 100 events instead of 1000); progress meta sent with every batch; logging reduced to every 1000 events (event_count % 1000 == 0) to prevent log spam; provides near real-time feedback while maintaining good indexing performance",
    "7.2.19": "Debug - Enhanced Chainsaw detection parsing logging; user reported logs showing 'Chainsaw returned 74 detection(s)' but '✓ Created 0 violation records' indicating parsing failure; added debug logging to output first detection JSON structure (first 500 chars) and keys for each detection; added warning when detection has no 'detections' list; helps diagnose JSON format mismatch between expected and actual Chainsaw v2.12.2 output format",
    "7.2.20": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected Chainsaw v2.12.2 JSON parsing logic; v7.2.0-7.2.19 incorrectly expected nested structure with 'detections' list inside each object; debug logs revealed actual format: each JSON object IS a detection (rule match) with fields ['group', 'kind', 'document', 'name', 'timestamp', 'authors', 'level', 'source', 'status', 'falsepositives', 'id', 'logsource', 'references', 'tags']; rewrote parser to extract rule_name/rule_id/rule_level directly from top level; matched event data is in 'document' field; extracts EventRecordID from document.Event.System.EventRecordID or document.System.EventRecordID; matches DB rules by title (exact) or YAML ID (substring); creates SigmaViolation records with proper event_id/case_id/file_id/rule_id; enriches OpenSearch events with sigma_detections; fixes root cause of '74 detections returned but 0 violations created' issue; violations should now appear in UI",
    "7.2.21": "Debug - Enhanced EventRecordID extraction with multiple fallback paths; user logs showed all 74 detections failing with 'Could not extract EventRecordID from detection'; added 4 extraction paths: doc.Event.System.EventRecordID, doc.System.EventRecordID, doc.EventRecordID, doc['System.EventRecordID']; added debug logging to show document keys (first 10) and document sample (first 500 chars) when extraction fails; will reveal actual Chainsaw document structure to fix field path",
    "7.2.22": "Critical Bugfix - Corrected Chainsaw document path for EventRecordID extraction; debug logs from v7.2.21 revealed actual structure: {'kind': 'evtx', 'path': '...', 'data': {'Event': {'System': {...}, 'EventData': {...}}}}; changed extraction from doc.Event.System.EventRecordID to doc.data.Event.System.EventRecordID; also changed event_data storage from full doc (includes wrapper) to just data (actual event); this matches how our indexing stores events; violations should now be created and linked to OpenSearch events correctly",
    "7.2.23": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed OpenSearch bulk update timeout type error; v7.2.22 successfully created violations (logs showed 'has_violations: true, violation_count: 1') but enrichment step failed with ValueError: 'Timeout value connect was 60s, but it must be an int, float or None'; enrich_events_with_detections() was passing timeout='60s' (string) to opensearch_client.bulk(); changed to timeout=60 (integer); OpenSearch Python client requires numeric timeout values; SIGMA detection pipeline now fully functional end-to-end: Chainsaw hunt → parse detections → create SigmaViolation records → enrich OpenSearch events with has_violations/violation_count/sigma_detections fields → violations appear in UI",
    "7.2.24": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed event search and Celery logging; user reported 'searching for 4624 or 4625 shows nothing' and Celery AttributeError; root cause: field mappings in build_opensearch_query() used dot notation (System.EventID.#text) but flatten_event() indexes with underscores (System_EventID_#text); corrected all 8 field mappings to use underscores matching actual indexed field names; fixed celery_app.py on_task_received signal attempting to log request.retries attribute which doesn't exist in Celery Request objects; EventID:4624 searches now work correctly",
    "7.2.25": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed 3 user-reported issues from clean install: 1) Progress not auto-updating - added 'Indexing' to activeFiles status detection (was checking Uploaded/Pending/Counting/Preparing/Running but missing Indexing); 2) SIGMA violations checkbox returning nothing - changed has_violations query from boolean True to string 'true' matching how OpenSearch bulk update stores it; 3) Event Type column (computed descriptions like 'Defender Signature Updated') not searchable - Event Type is UI-only, not indexed; search EventID/Channel/Provider fields directly or use plain text search; added sigma_violations and has_violations to search results for violation display",
    "7.2.26": "Debug - SIGMA violations filter still not working; user logs show query `{\"term\":{\"has_violations\":\"true\"}}` returns 0 hits and raw event data shows no has_violations field at all; bulk update likely failing silently; changed violations_only filter from term match to exists query (simpler, checks if field present); added detailed error logging to enrich_events_with_detections to log each bulk update error and full response when errors=true; will show why OpenSearch is rejecting the enrichment updates; user needs to re-run rules and check worker logs for update errors",
    "7.2.27": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed root cause of document_missing_exception in bulk enrichment; user logs showed all 74 updates failing with 'document missing' for IDs like 'b9633a96b7baaf7e'; issue: enrichment used event_id generated via sha256 hash BUT OpenSearch auto-generates different doc IDs during indexing; completely rewrote enrich_events_with_detections() to: 1) change parameter from detections_by_event to detections_by_record_number (keyed by EventRecordID not hash), 2) for each EventRecordID, query OpenSearch with term search on System_EventRecordID to find actual doc ID, 3) bulk update using actual OpenSearch doc IDs; this allows enrichment to find and update correct documents; violations checkbox and violation display should now work",
    "7.2.28": "Critical Bugfix - Fixed EventRecordID field lookup and added Event Type searchability; user logs still showed 0 hits after v7.2.27 because query searched System_EventRecordID field which doesn't exist in indexed docs; changed enrich_events_with_detections to search _casescope_metadata_record_number (actual indexed field); user also reported 'Event Type searching still does not work' because event_type was UI-only computed field; modified start_file_indexing to call get_event_description() during indexing and add event_type field to each indexed event; now users can search 'defender' to find Windows Defender events; requires re-index of existing files to get event_type field populated"
