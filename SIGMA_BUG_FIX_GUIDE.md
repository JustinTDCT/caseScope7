# SIGMA Filtering Bug - Fix Guide

**Version:** v7.40.0  
**Issue:** SIGMA Only/SIGMA or IOC/SIGMA + IOC filters show "Unknown Event" and "N/A" for all fields  
**Status:** Fix committed in v7.39.2, needs testing

---

## üîç Problem Summary

### What's Broken
1. ‚ùå **SIGMA Only** - Shows "Unknown Event", "N/A" for Event ID, Timestamp, Computer, Source File
2. ‚ùå **SIGMA or IOC** - Same issue as SIGMA Only
3. ‚ùå **SIGMA + IOC (Both)** - Returns no results despite overlapping events
4. ‚úÖ **IOC Only** - Works correctly

### Debug Output (from v7.39.1)
```
[Search] DEBUG - Threat filter sigma result keys: ['sigma_detections', 'has_violations', 'violation_count']
[Search] DEBUG - NO _casescope_metadata field!
[Search] DEBUG - Document ID: c9cea28c1b7ae68d
```

**Documents only have 3 fields** - missing ALL event data!

---

## üéØ Root Cause

**Type Mismatch in Document ID Generation**

**The Problem:**
- EventRecordID from XML: `123` (int)
- EventRecordID from Chainsaw: `"123"` (string) or int
- Python hashing: `sha256("56_123")` ‚â† `sha256("56_" + str(123))`

**The Result:**
- Indexing creates doc with ID: `abc123def456`
- SIGMA enrichment tries to update doc with ID: `xyz789ghi012` (different!)
- OpenSearch `doc_as_upsert: True` creates **NEW document** with only SIGMA fields
- Original document remains untouched
- SIGMA-only document returned by searches

**Identical to v7.32.2 bug** - same symptoms, same root cause, different trigger

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix (v7.39.2)

**6 str() conversions** added to ensure consistent type handling:

1. **Line 522** (bulk_index_events): `str(record_num)` before hashing
2. **Line 345** (enrich_events_with_detections): `str(record_num)` before hashing
3. **Line 697** (index_evtx_file): Convert event_record_id to string
4. **Line 707** (metadata): Store record_number as string
5. **Line 1042** (process_sigma_rules): Convert EventRecordID to string
6. **Line 1090** (detections dict): Use string keys

---

## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Worker (CRITICAL)
```bash
sudo systemctl restart casescope-worker
sudo systemctl status casescope-worker
```

**Why:** Worker must pick up new code with str() conversions

### Step 2: Re-run SIGMA Rules (One File)
1. Go to **Files** page
2. Find a file with SIGMA violations
3. Click **"‚ö° Re-run Rules"**
4. Wait for completion

**Why:** Re-running rules will re-enrich with correct doc IDs

### Step 3: Check Worker Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u casescope-worker -f --since "1 minute ago"
```

**Look for (if fix is working):**
```
[SIGMA Enrichment] file_id=56, record_num=12345, doc_id=abc123def456
[SIGMA Enrichment] ‚úì Successfully enriched 100 events with NO errors
```

**Red flags (if fix not working):**
```
[SIGMA Enrichment] Bulk update had errors!
[SIGMA Enrichment] Update error: document_missing_exception
```

### Step 4: Test SIGMA Filtering
1. Go to **Search** page
2. Select **"SIGMA Only"** from Threat Filtering dropdown
3. Click **Search**
4. Check if results show:
   - ‚úÖ Event ID (not "N/A")
   - ‚úÖ Timestamp (not "N/A")
   - ‚úÖ Computer name (not "N/A")
   - ‚úÖ Event Type (not "Unknown Event")

### Step 5: Test Combined Filters
1. Test **"SIGMA or IOC"** - should show events
2. Test **"SIGMA + IOC (Both)"** - should show overlapping events

---

## üîß If Fix Doesn't Work

### Scenario A: Worker Logs Show Errors
**Symptom:** `document_missing_exception` or other update errors

**Action:**
1. Copy error messages
2. Check if doc_id from enrichment matches actual OpenSearch doc _id
3. May need to investigate further

### Scenario B: No Debug Output in Logs
**Symptom:** No "[SIGMA Enrichment]" messages in worker logs

**Action:**
1. Worker didn't pick up new code
2. Try: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart casescope-worker`
3. Check which version of tasks.py worker is using

### Scenario C: Still Shows 3 Fields
**Symptom:** SIGMA results still only have `['sigma_detections', 'has_violations', 'violation_count']`

**Action:**
1. These are OLD orphaned documents
2. Need to **Re-index** (not just Re-run Rules)
3. Re-index creates fresh documents with v7.39.2 code

---

## üìä Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Newly Processed Files
‚úÖ Upload ‚Üí Index ‚Üí SIGMA ‚Üí Enrichment updates existing docs
‚úÖ SIGMA filtering shows complete event data

### For Existing Files
‚ö†Ô∏è Old orphaned SIGMA-only documents remain
‚úÖ Re-run Rules ‚Üí Re-enriches with correct doc IDs
‚úÖ OR Re-index ‚Üí Creates fresh documents

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. ‚úÖ Worker logs show successful enrichment (no errors)
2. ‚úÖ SIGMA Only filter displays Event ID, Timestamp, Computer
3. ‚úÖ SIGMA or IOC filter returns results
4. ‚úÖ SIGMA + IOC (Both) filter finds overlapping events
5. ‚úÖ Event details expand and show full data

---

## üìù Notes

- **Fix is in v7.39.2** - Already committed
- **Requires worker restart** - Must pick up new code
- **Existing files** - May need Re-run Rules or Re-index
- **New files** - Will work immediately after worker restart

---

## üöÄ Quick Test Command

```bash
# On server
sudo systemctl restart casescope-worker
# Wait 5 seconds, then check status
sudo systemctl status casescope-worker

# Watch worker logs during Re-run Rules
sudo journalctl -u casescope-worker -f
```

Then in UI:
1. Files ‚Üí Re-run Rules on one file
2. Wait for completion
3. Search ‚Üí SIGMA Only
4. Check if Event ID/Timestamp/Computer display correctly
